            <p align="left"><em>Reading, Writing, and Rising Up</em> is a rich resource for future English teachers centering on the voices and experiences of diverse students and setting forward powerful social justice approaches to teaching English. </p>
            <p align="left">For this assignment students will work together in teams to teach the rest of the class about the essential ideas of each chapter. </p>
            <p align="left">Student leaders are responsible for: </p>
			  <blockquote>
			    <p align="left">1) selecting reading -  choose a significant part of the chapter (at least half), and additional reading, viewing, or activities that help future teachers better understand the ideas and context (diverse students and schools) of the chapter;</p>
			    <p align="left"> 2) developing and leading class activities - may include actually engaging in the writing/reading/ activities described in the chapter; </p>
			    <p align="left">3) creating assignments that allow future teachers to demonstrate their understanding of the content; and, </p>
			    <p align="left">4) evaluating and providing feedback on assignments. </p>
		    <p align="left"></blockquote>
			  </p>
            <p align="left">These 
              units are not intended to be &quot;practice&quot; teaching where you 
              try to create lessons appropriate to secondary students and your classmates 
              try to &quot;guess&quot; how secondary students might respond. Instead, 
              this is <em>real</em> teaching where your students are your colleagues, 
              all potential teachers, learning about important ideas about how to teach English. </p>
            <p align="left">Putting together the day's lesson will require meeting together outside of class, group learning, team teaching, and collegial collaboration. &nbsp;All students are expected to take responsibility for their share of group work while cooperating with others in a respectful, supportive, and critically reflective way. </p>
          </center>
         
          <p align="left">
          <div align="left">
            <p>As a student leader you are 
              responsible for learning your chapter well, and, then, as a collaborative 
              group, carefully thinking about how students might meaningfully learn about it, and perhaps making some decisions about how to limit and focus the topic in order to be 
              most effective given time limitations. </p>
          </div>
          
        <p align="left"></center></div>
      <p align="left"> In addition to reading, all units should 
        include some kind of written assignment. This can be in the form of lesson plans, journals, free writing, narrative or persuasive writing, etc. It is fair to 
        expect work to be typed and well-edited. </p>
      <p align="left"><em> Reading, Writing, and Rising Up</em> does not do a lot with technology, still your group should feel free to experiment with our wireless-laptop 
        computers, use websites, data projectors, powerpoint... </p>
      <p align="left">At the first class meeting after the unit is completed 
        group leaders should: 1) turn in a grade for other students (can be a letter grade, a check/plus/minus, or credit/no credit); 2) an individual self-evaluation (comment especially about what you learned about yourself and how you can improve as a team teacher) and propose a grade for their personal contribution to the leadership of the unit. </p>
      <p align="left">Your group should start meeting as soon as possible. </p>
