        <p align="left">Class participation is one of the most important parts 
          of this course. Your class participation grade (100 pts) is made up 
          of literature circles (50 pts), Confer (20 pts), film festival (15 pts), 
          and the counterpart assignment (15 pts). Extra credit is available for 
          your own independent research of African culture and issues (10 pts). 
          Film festival attendance and independent work should also be reported 
          on Nicenet. This self-evaluation does not include your class attendance. 
          (As stated on the syllabus, if you missed three or fewer classes it 
          will have no impact on your final grade.) </p>
        <p align="left">Literature Circles:</p>
        <p align="left">The literature circle assignment took place in nine class 
          meetings over five full weeks of class time. Over this time the syllabus 
          states that students were to read four to five novels of about 200 pages 
          each. One novel was supposed to provide a Euro/American perspective 
          on Africa, and a film from the same perspective was also to be viewed. 
          Students were responsible for identifying and obtaining their own books, 
          reading independently, coming to class prepared to discuss the works, 
          and making a supportive contribution to their group. </p>

        <p align="left">Nicenet:</p>
        <p align="left">Nicenet provided a forum for extended class discussion 
          on our reading, for working together on the midterm, for exchanging 
          ideas about explorations into African culture, etc. By the end of the 
          class, there have been a total of 30 different topics that you could 
          contribute to. How often did you use Nicenet? How many topics did you 
          contribute to?</p>

          Film Festival:</p>
        <p align="left">The first sentence of our syllabus states that &quot;This 
          course will examine the realities of contemporary Africa primarily through 
          a study of modern African literature and film.&quot; While not all films 
          at the Franco-phone film festival addressed Africa, any of those films 
          could be counted toward the expectation of viewing three films (two 
          shorts = one feature length). Students who could not attend the festival 
          were invited to view African films on their own from Sangren film/video 
          library. Comments on the films viewed should be posted on Nicenet.<br>
          Total points, 15 possible:______</p>
        <p align="left"><br>
          Counterpart Assignment:</p>
        <p align="left">Everyone in class had different experiences with the counterpart 
          activity; often your experience depended more on your counterpart than 
          on you. I hope you were one of the lucky ones with a good counterpart 
          exchange! As far as your self-evaluation for this activity goes, I expect 
          that you made a good effort to exchange emails with a counterpart, at 
          least trying more than once to write to more than one potential counterpart.</p>

          EXTRA CREDIT: </p>
        <p align="left">This item is to record your independent research into 
          African culture and issues beyond what was assigned in class. This might 
          include library or internet research, viewing additional films, trying 
          African food, attending cultural events, etc. Full comments on your 
          independent research should be posted on Nicenet. Here simple list independent 
          research activities you undertook: __________________________________________<br>
