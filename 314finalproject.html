          Project</b></font></font>
        <p align="left">The final project can be undertaken individually or in 
          groups. It is due at the time of the meeting for the final exam for 
          this course--during which time students will also present their project 
          to the rest of the class. This project can be written up in the usual 
          way or you turn your project in as a website (publish at <a href="sites.google.com">Google Sites</a> ). 
          Depending on the project, I expect it will be in the 8-10 page range. 
          The projects of students working in groups should be longer, of course. 
          Remember to indicate your sources! Students can choose from the following 
          activities: 
        <p align="left">1) Design a curriculum unit for teaching African literature 
          / culture. Choose a specific grade level, from elementary to college 
          and create a curriculum for at least six weeks. Your curriculum should 
          include reading and writing activities, draw on literature and other 
          cultural works appropriate to the age and ability of your students and 
          integrate on-line resources. This project should begin with a description 
          of the course and how it seeks to help students learn about Africa, 
          a statement of your goals, and a justification of works included in 
          your syllabus and your approach to teaching. It should include a syllabus 
          of reading and activities, sample lesson plans, handouts, assignments, 
          letters to parents, etc.
        <p align="left">2. Develop a plan and begin to address a problem or issue 
          in Africa. Working alone, in groups, or with your counterpart identify 
          an issue or problem such as hunger, aids, education, political freedom, 
          land ownership, rights of women, illiteracy, environmental degradation, 
          migration of workers, corruption, democracy, etc. Study groups that 
          are currently working to address this concern. What could you do to 
          add your influence to solving this problem? (That includes the possibility 
          of working with or raising funds for an exisiting group.) Develop a 
          plan that includes a description of the problem, an examination of solutions, 
          and ideas for what you can do. If possible, follow your plan, or, at 
          least, set it in motion. (I am looking for your thinking and writing, 
          based on your research. Copies of webpages while they can be included 
        if truly useful, do not count toward your page total.) </p>
        <p align="left">3. Develop a detailed plan for your own further study 
          of Africa and African literature, including a trip to the continent. 
          What are your primary areas of interest? Why? What works do you want 
          to read or view? Why? How will you organize your reading and study? 
          Where will you go? Why? How will you learn about Africa while you are 
          there? What are the logistics and expenses of your trip? How will you 
          share what you have learned when you complete your study and visit? 
          How does this project fit with your education and life goals? How will you be more than just an American tourist? How can you go beyond exploitation of African's for the sake of your education? (I am 
          looking for your thinking and writing, based on your research, not just a travel itinerary. Copies 
          of webpages while they can be included if truly useful, do not count 
          toward your page total.) <br>
