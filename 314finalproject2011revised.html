        <p align="left">Based on a class consensus the decision was made to collaborate as a single group and revise the original Solutions Project  (see below) to focus on child immunization in Africa.        
        <p align="left">Students have divided into teams to support this project and undertaken a remarkable variety of projects from the creation of an on-going registered student organization (RSO) on our campus (Students for Africa), the development of a website, selling wrist bands,  creating tee shirts, sponsoring bake sales,  an open mike event, and other activities and events<a href="w4w.html">t</a>.         
        <p align="left">The revised final project:        
        <p align="left">1.  Carry out all plans to support the development of the RSO.         (All class members participate.)         
        
        <p align="left">2. Carry out all plans for fund raising activities. (All class members participate.)         
        <p align="left">2.  Develop a website to support the RSO and fundraising and document class activities.
        <p align="left">3.  Each class member writes a two-page summary analysis of their individual work, what they learned, and proposes a final grade for the project (grade will be subject to professor approval).           
        <p align="left">4.  Each student develops a short (5-minute) <a href="http://www.prezi.com">Prezi</a>, <a href="http://www.glogster.com">Glogster</a>, or Powerpoint presentation to be made at the time of our final exam that addresses the question: <strong>What next?</strong>   Students can choose one of the following types of presentations:             
        <ul>
          <li>
            <div align="left">Specific ideas and plans for the continued activity of the RSO in future semesters.</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div align="left">A realistic plan to visit or work in Africa. </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div align="left">A set of ideas and plan to teach African literature in a secondary school. </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div align="left">Solid information about a non-governmental organization doing good work in Africa that we should all know about. </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div align="left">An intriguing report on a book of African literature, or about Africa, that you have read, started reading, or want to read, and why it might interest other class members. </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div align="left">Propose a topic or issue of your choosing related to Africa about which you would like to learn more, and steps and ideas you could take to do so. </div>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p align="left"><font color="#33CCFF" size="+2"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"><b>Solutions Project <em>Original</em></b></font></font>        
        <p align="left">The Solutions Project can be undertaken in 
          groups of three to six students. Students will select their own project related to a topic addressed in course reading. Projects will be developed / reported / published on via a public wiki, created at <a href="http://www.wikispaces.com">Wikispaces</a>.        
        <p align="left">At the time of the meeting for the final exam for 
          this course students will  present their project 
          to the rest of the class. The written part of the project should be at minimum the rough equivalent of ten pages per participant. 
        Your wiki should be richly informative, deeply connected to relevant resources, demonstrate collaboration and meaningful action. 
        <p align="left">The solutions projects should have the following features:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <div align="left">Research that richly and carefully analyzes the problem addressed. (20 pts) </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div align="left">Collaboration with organizations, experts, and Africans. (30 pts) </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div align="left">Plan or program of action for your participation in a &quot;solution.&quot; (10 pts) </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div align="left">Report on steps undertaken. This report can take many forms including journals, observations, documents, photos, film, interviews, etc. (40 pts) </div>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p align="left">All students are expected to demonstrate the finest skills of collaboration and team work. Each student will submit a two-page analysis of their work and propose a final grade for the project, subject to professor modification.<br>
