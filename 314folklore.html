        <p align="left">Oral traditions are the starting point for African literature. 
          Folklore, folk tales, oral poetry, praise poems, historical epics, elegies, 
          and proverbs are all common forms. 
        <p align="left">Your assignment is to study African folklore available 
          on the web, especially from the <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/afr/">Internet 
          Sacred Text Archive</a> collections from South Africa, Bantu, West and 
          Central Africa. In addition to the Sacred Text Archive, you can also 
          look at other sites on the web for African folklore, such as, <a href="http://www.msu.edu/user/hamza/BuraFolktales.htm">Bura 
          Folktales</a>, <a href="http://www.motherlandnigeria.com/stories.html">Nigerian 
          Stories</a>, <a href="http://www.canteach.ca/elementary/africa.html">Zulu 
          Folktales</a>, etc. 
        <p align="left">1. First immerse yourself in this folklore. Read at least 
          50 pages. Think about these questions: What are the characters like? 
          What values do the stories express? What sort of societies do you imagine 
          that these stories come from? How were the stories collected?
        <p align="left">2. Choose your favorite or most interesting stories, at 
          least three or four, cut and paste them, print, and bring to class prepared 
          to share with others. 
        <p align="left">3. Respond to the <a href="http://vms.cc.wmich.edu/www/confer/">confer</a> 
          item on African folklore. 
        <p align="left">4. Create a teaching unit for African folklore for an 
          age level of your choosing..</p>
      </div>
      <div align="left"> 
        <ul>
          <li> Choose an appropriate age range from the following: grades 1-3, 
            grades 4-6, grades 7-9, grades 10-12, college.</li>
          <li> Choose several stories (at least 3 for a &quot;C&quot;, 5 for a 
            &quot;B&quot;, and 7 for an &quot;A&quot; -- long stories can be double, 
            or even triple counted) and cut and paste these into a document.</li>
          <li>Choose a title for your unit--your assignment will be posted on 
            the web based on the grade level you create it for and the title, 
            so make the title appropriate and interesting.</li>
          <li> Write an introduction to your African folklore unit that includes 
            information about what they are about and where they come from as 
            best as you can learn (including a webpage link and bibliographical 
            information).</li>
          <li>Write 4-8 study or <a href="http://vms.cc.wmich.edu/%7Ecareywebb/discussion.html">discussion 
            questions</a> about each story. These should not be just &quot;fact 
            recall&quot; but really help the students understand the stories.</li>
          <li>Write 1-3 &quot;essay&quot; or overall questions that involve comparison 
            and contrast and higher level thinking.</li>
          <li>Very carefully edit and make corrections on your assignment. It 
            is going to go on the web!</li>
          <li>Send the completed assignment, including the texts of the folktales 
            to Professor Webb as an email attachment. (allen.webb@wmich.edu)</li>
        </ul>

      <p>Here is a pretty good <a href="http://ex.matrix.msu.edu/africa/curriculum/lm11/2africanfolktales.htm">sample 
        assignment </a>to give you ideas for what your unit might look like. </p>
      <p>These projects will be posted on the &quot;Teaching About African Literature&quot; 
        site that our class is developing.</p>
