Course<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Helvetica">For the final assignment in this
class I would like you to envision a semester long course that
involves the best practices for the teaching of writing and, in
one way or another, incorporates the concept of autoethnography.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Helvetica">You may choose any course relevant
to your professional interests, a high school or middle school
English class focused on writing, literature, speech, journalism,
or combined language arts; a social studies or science or math
course; an English as a second language course; an English 100
course; a GED course; etc. Assume that you have complete freedom
to develop this course as you think best and that funding for
texts and resources will be no problem. Give the class its own
special focus and express your personal and professional values
and beliefs in the way that you put it together. You can &quot;transform&quot;
a course that is already taught or create an entirely new course
out of whole cloth. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Helvetica">Your project should begin with a
description of the course and a statement of the course goals
. Describe the role or roles that writing will play in your course.
Describe how your course draws on the autoethnographic concept.
Be specific about age level, and the social and cultural background
of your students. Assume that there are mixed ability levels (reading
levels may be spread out over a 4-6 year range, you may have special
education students, etc.) and indicate in your project how different
ability levels will be addressed. Focus on your content and develop
assignments and activities that organically flow from it. Think
careful about how the course will develop from beginning to end.
Try to sequence assignments, reading, and activities to develop
increasing student independence. Demonstrate high expectation,
relevant curriculum, and intellectual and social meaning.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Helvetica">Your project should include: a descrition
of the course content and a goal statement that tie your course
to autoethnography; a carefully described and justified sequence
of writing assignments and activities; a clear incorporation of
the writing process; a plan for responding to and evaluating student
work; and a <B>self-evaluation</B> of the strengths and weaknesses
of your project. Be thoughtful in your self-evaluation and give
yourself a grade on this project. Within this framework you have
considerable freedom to structure this assignment as you wish,
to emphasize either the narrative description of the class, timeline,
unit and lessson plans, and/or specific materials and handouts.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Helvetica">To the extent to which you see fit,
you may include sample lessons plans, class activities, hand outs,
etc. You are encouraged to include materials developed during
the &quot;Literature Circles&quot; portion of this class-if these
material are not your own be sure to indicate who created them.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Helvetica">I think it would take at least ten
to twelve pages to accomplish the assignment at a minimum level.
I hope that whatever you come up with will be a kind of rough
draft to return to again and again as you move on in your career
and make your dream course a living reality.<BR>
