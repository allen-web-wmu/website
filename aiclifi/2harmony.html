<p class="text">In a world not so different from our own, the heartbeat of nature echoed through a vibrant landscape teeming with life, the sun-dappled forests, meandering rivers and sprawling grasslands were home to a diverse tapestry of creatures, each intricately connected to the delicate balance to their shared home. However, a subtle shift in the atmosphere heralded the arrival of a new era—one where the world was two degrees hotter. 

<p class="text">As the seasons unfolded, the once predictable patterns of life underwent a profound transformation.in the heart of the verdant woodlands, a family of deer navigated the dense underbrush. Their usual grazing grounds had transformed into parched meadows, and the crystal-clear streams that once quenched their thirst had dwindled to mere trickles. 

<p class="text">High above, the soaring eagles circled the sky with watchful eyes. They prey they relied on for sustenance had adapted to the changing climate, altering their migration routes and behavior. The once graceful dance of predator and prey now resembled a delicate game of survival in the face of the world growing warmer by the day. 

<p class="text">The vibrant coral reefs beneath the ocean's surface, once a kaleidoscope of colors, began to fade. The rising temperatures stressed the corals, leading to widespread bleaching that left the once-thriving marine ecosystems eerily pale. The intricate ballet of underwater life—nudibranchs, clownfish, and majestic sea turtles—was disrupted by the haunting silence of dying reefs. 

<p class="text">In the heat of the grassy savannah, a lion pride roamed in search of prey. The shifting climate altered the behavior of the herbivore they hunted, making the once-mighty predators face new challenges. Longer droughts led to diminished water sources, forcing both predators and prey to adapt to a harsher reality. 

<p class="text">Amidst the chaos, the wise old elephant matriarch led her across the vast plains. The scarcity of water and changing vegetation patterns posed a threat to the delicate balance between their massive footsteps and the delicate ecosystems they traversed. The once fertile lands were now scarred by the impacts of a world growing two degrees hotter. 

<p class="text">As the seasons cycled through, a sense of urgency enveloped the natural world. The interconnected web of life that once thrived in harmony now faces the daunting challenge of adaptation. Some species, resilient and adaptive, found new ways to coexist. Others struggled, their once-prosperous habitats becoming increasingly inhospitable. 

<p class="text">Yet, even in the face of adversity, there were glimmers of hope. Creatures large and small forged unexpected alliances, discovering strength in unity. The intricate dance of life continued, but the rhythm was now accompanied by the haunting echos of a world grappling with the consequences of a two degree rise in temperature. 

<p class="text">In this changing landscape, the resilient spirit of the natural world whispered tales of adaptation, urging its inhabitants to navigate the challenge with courage and solidarity. For within the heart of this two-degree world, the delicate tapestry of life sought to find a new harmony, a balance reshaped by the unstoppable forces of change.

I asked ChatGPT to create a story about how wildlife will be during the different degrees, which were one degree to six degrees. I went through the degrees to find differences in the stories, but I liked how the two-degree world was written. 

<p class="text">When I was asked ChatGPT to write me a story more aimed at wildlife than the earth itself. As much as the earth is important, our wildlife is just as important. Each time I had put new prompts in I could get a different story, but also the same. How the corals are becoming pale, or the thirst is becoming too great or how migration has changed its course and has messed up their migration schedule. Since ChatGPT is some sort of intellectual generator, it wants to give me good endings. But does ChatGPT know about the bad ones? Does it know what would actually happen if the world had reached a two-degree hotter world? It does not know how much would be truly affected. We do have people who will suffer, yes, but also the animals. For instance, we can look at polar bears who live in cold climates. What would happen if their habitat slowly started melting away and started heating up? Well, we already know what will happen because it is happening right now. Now imagine what it would be like if we were in a two-degree world, in which we are not far from at all.
