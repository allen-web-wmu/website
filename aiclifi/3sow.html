<p class="text">In the not-so-distant future, as the Earth warmed by 3 degrees Celsius above pre industrial temperatures, a determined scientist named Dr. Thomas Reynolds sought to address the global food crisis. Faced with the challenge of feeding a growing population in the changing climate, he embarked on a groundbreaking journey of genetic modification.

<p class="text">Dr. Reynolds dedicated his life to developing a strain of wheat that could thrive in the altered conditions. After years of meticulous research and experimentation, he successfully created a genetically modified organism (GMO) known as "Evergreen Wheat." This hardy crop promised to withstand the challenges of the warming climate, offering a lifeline for communities struggling with food scarcity.

<p class="text">As Evergreen Wheat became a staple in diets worldwide, hailed as a solution to famine and agricultural collapse, unforeseen consequences began to surface. Several generations later, a disturbing pattern emerged among the people who had consumed products made from this genetically modified wheat.

<p class="text">Reports of birth defects spread like wildfire. Babies were born with extra limbs, a bizarre consequence of the genetic modifications designed to ensure the wheat's resilience. Panic and fear gripped communities as the once-hopeful solution to food scarcity transformed into a silent epidemic.

<p class="text">Dr. Reynolds, now aged and haunted by the unintended consequences of his creation, felt a heavy burden of responsibility. As communities grappled with the fallout, he embarked on a new mission to find a remedy for the genetic abnormalities plaguing the population.

<p class="text">The search for a solution led Dr. Reynolds to collaborate with other scientists, bioethicists, and medical experts. Together, they worked tirelessly to unravel the complexities of the modified genes and mitigate the impact on human health.

<p class="text">In a race against time, the scientific community faced moral dilemmas and ethical questions about the consequences of tampering with nature. As debates raged on, the affected communities demanded accountability and justice.

<p class="text">The story of Evergreen Wheat became a cautionary tale, a reminder of the delicate balance between scientific innovation and unforeseen consequences. Dr. Reynolds, once celebrated as a visionary, now grappled with the unintended legacy of his creation, while the world wrestled with the ethical implications of playing with the very fabric of life in the pursuit of survival.

ChatGPT prompt: Tell me a story about a man who genetically modified a kind of wheat that can be grown in the climate that has warmed to 3 degrees Celsius above pre industrial temperatures. But, a few generations of people have been eating these GMO wheat products and they start having birth defects. People start growing extra limbs because of the GMO.
