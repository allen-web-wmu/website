<p class="text">In the scorching year of 2070, the world was an oven, with temperatures soaring five degrees above pre-industrial levels. As the main character, Alex, trudged through the desolate landscape, memories of the day his father succumbed to the relentless heatstroke haunted him. They had been traveling to a supposed sanctuary, guided by a scavenger they encountered on the sun-baked streets. 

<p class="text">The scavenger had painted a vivid picture of a haven, a place where people thrived amidst the chaos—a paradise that seemed to defy the harsh reality of the outside world. Alex's father, desperate for a glimmer of hope, had decided to follow this scavenger's lead. 

<p class="text">As Alex recounted the tragedy, he caught sight of the distant walls that marked the sanctuary. Excitement surged within him; relief was finally within reach. But as he approached the heavily guarded entrance, his anticipation turned to trepidation. 

<p class="text">The guards, clad in makeshift uniforms, eyed him suspiciously. The scavenger who had promised them salvation stood at the gate, grinning slyly. The realization hit Alex like a wave of heat—the sanctuary was not what it seemed. 

<p class="text">Thrown into chains and forced forward, Alex found himself in the company of others who had fallen prey to the false promise of safety. In a cage adjacent to his, a weary man with hollow eyes spoke in hushed tones. 

<p class="text">"Welcome to the real sanctuary," the man whispered, bitterness tainting his voice. "But it's not salvation—it's a prison." 

<p class="text">As Alex tried to make sense of the situation, the truth unfolded before him. The walled-off city wasn't a refuge; it was a nightmare. The crazed inhabitants within the walls resorted to unthinkable measures to survive. Cannibalism had become a grim reality, and the once-promised sanctuary had transformed into a gory spectacle. 

<p class="text">As Alex was shoved into a cage, he glimpsed the scavenger receiving a reward from the guards for leading another unsuspecting victim into their clutches. Betrayal burned hotter than the scorching sun, leaving Alex with a bitter taste of despair. In this dystopian world, trust was a scarce commodity, and even the promise of sanctuary could turn out to be the cruelest deception.

I started with a basic idea of asking ChatGPT to draft a story about a man who loses his father to heatstroke, it gave me a promising start but required more. I slowly shaped and added certain parts to the story asking for certain parts to be changed and certain dialogue to be fixed. I also added the twist at the end, headed in that direction but needed me to put in the prompt to get there.
