	Based on ice cores, tree rings, and coral deposits, scientists have determined that 2023 was likely the hottest year in <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/12/28/1221827923/2023-hottest-year-record-climate-change" target="_blank">the last 125,000 years</a> equaling or surpassing the <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement">Paris Agreement</a> target of 1.5ºC warming above the preindustrial average global temperature. Due to human caused greenhouse gas emissions future years will be even hotter.</p>
	<p class="text">In the 2024 Spring Semester Western Michigan University students in <a href="https://allen-webb-wmu.github.io/website/envs4120s24.html" target="_blank">English/Environmental Studies 4120</a> taught by <a href="http://www.allenwebb.net">Dr. Allen Webb</a> engaged in an experiment to collaborate with <a href="https://chat.openai.com/" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a> to write stories about the climate future.
    <p class="text">Envisioning the climate future, and what can be done to influence it, was the focus of the course and the course began by students reading <em><a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/our-final-warning-six-degrees-of-climate-emergency-mark-lynas?variant=32888866996258" target="_blank">Our Final Warning</a></em> by Mark Lynas (2020) which sets forth scientific understanding (modelling and paleoclimatology) of what will happen to the earth as global temperatures increase.  That book is in six chapters, each chapter describing increasing warming degree by degree celsius up to 6º, a temperature considered possible by the scientists of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/" target="_blank">IPCC</a>) by the year 2100, a date perhaps even within the life time of students in the course.
    <p class="text">Drawing on their knowledge of expected climate futures students worked with ChatGPT to create the cli-fi short stories published on this website. The <a href="https://allen-webb-wmu.github.io/website/envsaaiclifi.html" target="_blank">project assignment</a> included writing a diversity of stories, picking the best one, working more extensively with that story, working with an AI image program to create a corresponding image, and writing an analysis of the stories and the process of writing with ChatGPT. </p>
	<p class="text">Comments from students about the project:</p>
	<p class="text"><strong>Griffin Harmer</strong>: This project showed me how all the different futures described in the stories might be possible in the future if we do not start taking care of our planet. </p>
	<p class="text"><strong>Savanah Wirth</strong>: Although the AI seems to have an understanding of the impacts of climate change, in the stories the effects didn’t vary much between the different degrees of warming that I input. I found that just telling the program “The climate had warmed to 4 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures” wasn’t enough for the program to give much climatic details. It knows generally that the climate will become more unstable and that more extreme weather events will occur, but if I wanted more detail consistent with the scientific predictions we have studied, I would have to prompt it with specifics, such as “The river was flooding because of the changing climate conditions.” </p>
	<p class="text"><strong>Jackson Hammerschmidt</strong>: We have a problem that our world is facing, the raising temperatures impact everything you can think of. Currently, it might be as small as a few unforeseen storms, light flooding, and heatwaves. But these stories about far more extreme events in the future describe real possibilities.  Writing short stories explaining what could happen is important, whether it is leaving your homeland because it is left uninhabitable, or as small as athletic performance being impacted. These stories prepare us and organizations to advocate for policy changes, sustainable practices, and collective action. Writing is one of the most impactful thing we can do. People need to know what our changing climate is capable of doing to our lives.</p>
	<p class="text"><strong>Kaely Cooper</strong>:&nbsp;Writing these stories made me think further about how global warming will affect every aspect of this planet. This is why I wanted one of my stories to be from the perspective of an animal, in order to make people think about not only what global warming means for humans, but every organism on the planet.&nbsp;</p>
