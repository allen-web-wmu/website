    <p class="text">Drawing on their knowledge of expected climate futures students worked with <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a> to create the cli-fi short stories published on this website. The <a href="https://allen-webb-wmu.github.io/website/envsaaiclifi.html" target="_blank">project assignment</a> included writing a diversity of stories, picking the best one, working more extensively with that story, working with an AI image program to create a corresponding image, and writing an analysis of the stories and the process of writing with ChatGPT. 
	<p class="text">The project represents an experiment in thinking about how to combine meaningful use of generative artificial intelligence with teaching and writing. And there was a certain appropriateness to using AI technologies to help imagine the future. Though we may also be able to use AI to reduce greenhouse gasses, doing so sufficiently to avoid worst case warming scenarios will require human intelligence, political will, overcoming vested interests, and expanding global cooperation.
	<p class="text">Comments from students about ChatGPT:</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p class="text"><b>Donavin Harte</b>: This writing project was one of the most interesting ones I’ve worked on. Using ChatGPT as a tool was quite amazing. I was very impressed how well of a story a machine could pump out in a few seconds from a prompt as short as two sentences. With that being said, the initial stories needed to be worked on. ChatGPT likes to give very generalized ideas without much context or in-depth detail even if you give it a longer prompt. It also likes to use the same words, phrases, and paragraph structure multiple times throughout one story. This makes for a bad reading experience and confuses a reader. However, you can sit and develop the story more. You can tell it to add more detail and description, or to change words, or to change anything about the story you’d like to. On the other hand, you could just take that initial story and then change what you don’t like about it yourself. I feel that this was the easiest way to develop a story that you may have in your head. ChatGPT generates the story as a sort-of outline and then you can make it how your imagination wants it to be and fine tune any issues that may have risen. </p>
	  <p class="text"><strong>Olivia McQueen</strong>:&nbsp;I wanted to generate stories that are set in the high degrees of global warming (4-6 degrees) with different plot lines that are set in different areas of the U.S. and at least one in another region of the world. Using different areas of the country and world I was curious to see how the effects of climate change differed according to ChatGBT. I thought that ChatGBT did a great job at generating a variation of story lines with different characters as well as being pretty correct about the effects of climate change on these specific areas for the degree of warming. I really enjoyed this project and the use of AI to create stories. It was my first time using any sort of AI that isn’t already on social media and I’m glad it was a good experience. &nbsp;</p>
