            <p align="center"><strong>Reproduction of Labour-Power </strong> </p>
            <p>How is the reproduction of labour power ensured?  </p>
            <p>It is ensured by giving labour power the material means with which to reproduce itself: by wages. Wages feature in the accounting of each enterprise, but as &lsquo;wage capital&rsquo;, not at all as a condition of the material reproduction of labour power.  However, that is in fact how it &lsquo;works&rsquo;, since wages represents only that part of the value produced by the expenditure of labour power which is indispensable for its reproduction: so indispensable to the reconstitution of the labour power of the wage-earner (the wherewithal to pay for housing, food and clothing, in short to enable the wage earner to present himself again at the factory gate the next day &ndash; and every further day God grants him); and we should add: indispensable for raising and educating the children in whom the proletarian reproduces himself (in n models where n = 0, 1, 2, etc....) as labour power. &hellip; </p>
            <p>How is this reproduction of the (diversified) skills of labour power provided for in a capitalist regime? Here, unlike social formations characterized by slavery or serfdom this reproduction of the skills of labour power tends (this is a tendential law) decreasingly to be provided for &lsquo;on the spot&rsquo; (apprenticeship within production itself), but is achieved more and more outside production: by the capitalist education system, and by other instances and institutions.  </p>
            <p>What do children learn at school? They go varying distances in their studies, but at any rate they learn to read, to write and to add &ndash; i.e. a number of techniques, and a number of other things as well, including elements (which may be rudimentary or on the contrary thoroughgoing) of &lsquo;scientific&rsquo; or &lsquo;literary culture&rsquo;, which are directly useful in the different jobs in production (one instruction for manual workers, another for technicians, a third for engineers, a final one for higher management, etc.). Thus they learn know-how.  But besides these techniques and knowledges, and in learning them, children at school also learn the &lsquo;rules&rsquo; of good behaviour, i.e. the attitude that should be observed by every agent in the division of labour, according to the job he is &lsquo;destined&rsquo; for: rules of morality, civic and professional conscience, which actually means rules of respect for the socio-technical division of labour and ultimately the rules of the order established by class domination. They also learn to &lsquo;speak proper French&rsquo;, to &lsquo;handle&rsquo; the workers correctly, i.e. actually (for the future capitalists and their servants) to &lsquo;order them about&rsquo; properly, i.e. (ideally) to &lsquo;speak to them&rsquo; in the right way, etc.  </p>
            <p>To put this more scientifically, I shall say that the reproduction of labour power requires not only a reproduction of its skills, but also, at the same time, a reproduction of its submission to the rules of the established order, i.e. a reproduction of submission to the ruling ideology for the workers, and a reproduction of the ability to manipulate the ruling ideology correctly for the agents of exploitation and repression, so that they, too, will provide for the domination of the ruling class &lsquo;in words&rsquo;.  In other words, the school (but also other State institutions like the Church, or other apparatuses like the Army) teaches &lsquo;know-how&rsquo;, but in forms which ensure subjection to the ruling ideology or the mastery of its &lsquo;practice&rsquo;. All the agents of production, exploitation and repression, not to speak of the &lsquo;professionals of ideology&rsquo; (Marx), must in one way or another be &lsquo;steeped&rsquo; in this ideology in order to perform their tasks &lsquo;conscientiously&rsquo; &ndash; the tasks of the exploited (the proletarians), of the exploiters (the capitalists), of the exploiters&rsquo; auxiliaries (the managers), or of the high priests of the ruling ideology (its &lsquo;functionaries&rsquo;), etc.  The reproduction of labour power thus reveals as its sine qua non not only the reproduction of its &lsquo;skills&rsquo; but also the reproduction of its subjection to the ruling ideology or of the &lsquo;practice&rsquo; of that ideology, with the proviso that it is not enough to say &lsquo;not only but also&rsquo;, for it is clear that it is in the forms and under the forms of ideological subjection that provision is made for the reproduction of the skills of labour power.  But this is to recognize the effective presence of a new reality: ideology. &hellip; </p>
            <p align="center"><strong>The State</strong></p>
            <p>The Marxist tradition is strict, here: in the Communist Manifesto and the Eighteenth Brumaire (and in all the later classical texts, above all in Marx&rsquo;s writings on the Paris Commune and Lenin&rsquo;s on State and Revolution), the State is explicitly conceived as a repressive apparatus. The State is a &lsquo;machine&rsquo; of repression, which enables the ruling classes (in the nineteenth century the bourgeois class and the &lsquo;class&rsquo; of big landowners) to ensure their domination over the working class, thus enabling the former to subject the latter to the process of surplus-value extortion (i.e. to capitalist exploitation).  </p>
            <p>The State is thus first of all what the Marxist classics have called the State Apparatus. This term means: not only the specialized apparatus (in the narrow sense) whose existence and necessity I have recognized in relation to the requirements of legal practice, i.e. the police, the courts, the prisons; but also the army, which (the proletariat has paid for this experience with its blood) intervenes directly as a supplementary repressive force in the last instance, when the police and its specialized auxiliary corps are &lsquo;outrun by events&rsquo;; and above this ensemble, the head of State, the government and the administration.  &hellip; </p>
            <p align="center"><strong>On the Reproduction of the Relations of Production</strong></p>
            <p>In the pre-capitalist historical period which I have examined extremely broadly, it is absolutely clear that there was one dominant Ideological State Apparatus, the Church, which concentrated within it not only religious functions, but also educational ones, and a large proportion of the functions of communications and &lsquo;culture&rsquo;. It is no accident that all ideological struggle, from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, starting with the first shocks of the Reformation, was concentrated in an anti-clerical and anti-religious struggle; rather this is a function precisely of the dominant position of the religious Ideological State Apparatus&hellip;. </p>
            <p>That is why I believe that I am justified in advancing the following Thesis, however precarious it is. I believe that the Ideological State Apparatus which has been installed in the dominant position in mature capitalist social formations as a result of a violent political and ideological class struggle against the old dominant Ideological State Apparatus, is the educational ideological apparatus&hellip;. </p>
            <p>Hence I believe I have good reasons for thinking that behind the scenes of its political Ideological State Apparatus, which occupies the front of the stage, what the bourgeoisie has installed as its number-one, i.e. as its dominant Ideological State Apparatus, is the educational apparatus, which has in fact replaced in its functions the previously dominant Ideological State Apparatus, the Church. One might even add: the School-Family couple has replaced the Church-Family couple.  </p>
            <p>Why is the educational apparatus in fact the dominant Ideological State Apparatus in capitalist social formations, and how does it function?  </p>
            <p>For the moment it must suffice to say:  </p>
            <p>1. All Ideological State Apparatuses, whatever they are, contribute to the same result: the reproduction of the relations of production, i.e. of capitalist relations of exploitation.  </p>
            <p>2. Each of them contributes towards this single result in the way proper to it. The political apparatus by subjecting individuals to the political State ideology, the &lsquo;indirect&rsquo; (parliamentary) or &lsquo;direct&rsquo; (plebiscitary or fascist) &lsquo;democratic&rsquo; ideology. The communications apparatus by cramming every &lsquo;citizen&rsquo; with daily doses of nationalism, chauvinism, liberalism, moralism, etc, by means of the press, the radio and television. The same goes for the cultural apparatus (the role of sport in chauvinism is of the first importance), etc. The religious apparatus by recalling in sermons and the other great ceremonies of Birth, Marriage and Death, that man is only ashes, unless he loves his neighbour to the extent of turning the other cheek to whoever strikes first. The family apparatus ...but there is no need to go on.  </p>
            <p>3. This concert is dominated by a single score, occasionally disturbed by contradictions (those of the remnants of former ruling classes, those of the proletarians and their organizations): the score of the Ideology of the current ruling class which integrates into its music the great themes of the Humanism of the Great Forefathers, who produced the Greek Miracle even before Christianity, and afterwards the Glory of Rome, the Eternal City, and the themes of Interest, particular and general, etc. nationalism, moralism and economism.  </p>
            <p>4. Nevertheless, in this concert, one Ideological State Apparatus certainly has the dominant role, although hardly anyone lends an ear to its music: it is so silent! This is the School.  </p>
            <p>It takes children from every class at infant-school age, and then for years, the years in which the child is most &lsquo;vulnerable&rsquo;, squeezed between the Family State Apparatus and the Educational State Apparatus, it drums into them, whether it uses new or old methods, a certain amount of &lsquo;know-how&rsquo; wrapped in the ruling ideology (French, arithmetic, natural history, the sciences, literature) or simply the ruling ideology in its pure state (ethics, civic instruction, philosophy). Somewhere around the age of sixteen, a huge mass of children are ejected &lsquo;into production&rsquo;: these are the workers or small peasants. Another portion of scholastically adapted youth carries on: and, for better or worse, it goes somewhat further, until it falls by the wayside and fills the posts of small and middle technicians, white-collar workers, small and middle executives, petty bourgeois of all kinds. A last portion reaches the summit, either to fall into intellectual semi-employment, or to provide, as well as the &lsquo;intellectuals of the collective labourer&rsquo;, the agents of exploitation (capitalists, managers), the agents of repression (soldiers, policemen, politicians, administrators, etc.) and the professional ideologists (priests of all sorts, most of whom are convinced &lsquo;laymen&rsquo;).  </p>
            <p>Each mass ejected en route is practically provided with the ideology which suits the role it has to fulfil in class society: the role of the exploited (with a &lsquo;highly-developed&rsquo; &lsquo;professional&rsquo;, &lsquo;ethical&rsquo;, &lsquo;civic&rsquo;, &lsquo;national&rsquo; and a-political consciousness); the role of the agent of exploitation (ability to give the workers orders and speak to them: &lsquo;human relations&rsquo;), of the agent of repression (ability to give orders and enforce obedience &lsquo;without discussion&rsquo;, or ability to manipulate the demagogy of a political leader&rsquo;s rhetoric), or of the professional ideologist (ability to treat consciousnesses with the respect, i.e. with the contempt, blackmail, and demagogy they deserve, adapted to the accents of Morality, of Virtue, of &lsquo;Transcendence&rsquo;, of the Nation, of France&rsquo;s World Role, etc.).  </p>
            <p>Of course, many of these contrasting Virtues (modesty, resignation, submissiveness on the one hand, cynicism, contempt, arrogance, confidence, self-importance, even smooth talk and cunning on the other) are also taught in the Family, in the Church, in the Army, in Good Books, in films and even in the football stadium. But no other Ideological State Apparatus has the obligatory (and not least, free) audience of the totality of the children in the capitalist social formation, eight hours a day for five or six days out of seven.  But it is by an apprenticeship in a variety of know-how wrapped up in the massive inculcation of the ideology of the ruling class that the relations of production in a capitalist social formation, i.e. the relations of exploited to exploiters and exploiters to exploited, are largely reproduced. The mechanisms which produce this vital result for the capitalist regime are naturally covered up and concealed by a universally reigning ideology of the School, universally reigning because it is one of the essential forms of the ruling bourgeois ideology: an ideology which represents the School as a neutral environment purged of ideology (because it is ...lay), where teachers respectful of the &lsquo;conscience&rsquo; and &lsquo;freedom&rsquo; of the children who are entrusted to them (in complete confidence) by their &lsquo;parents&rsquo; (who are free, too, i.e. the owners of their children) open up for them the path to the freedom, morality and responsibility of adults by their own example, by knowledge, literature and their &lsquo;liberating&rsquo; virtues.</p>
            <p> I ask the pardon of those teachers who, in dreadful conditions, attempt to turn the few weapons they can find in the history and learning they &lsquo;teach&rsquo; against the ideology, the system and the practices in which they are trapped. They are a kind of hero. But they are rare and how many (the majority) do not even begin to suspect the &lsquo;work&rsquo; the system (which is bigger than they are and crushes them) forces them to do, or worse, put all their heart and ingenuity into performing it with the most advanced awareness (the famous new methods!). So little do they suspect it that their own devotion contributes to the maintenance and nourishment of this ideological representation of the School, which makes the School today as &lsquo;natural&rsquo;, indispensable-useful and even beneficial for our contemporaries as the Church was &lsquo;natural&rsquo;, indispensable and generous for our ancestors a few centuries ago.  </p>
            <p>In fact, the Church has been replaced today in its role as the dominant Ideological State Apparatus by the School. It is coupled with the Family just as the Church was once coupled with the Family. We can now claim that the unprecedentedly deep crisis which is now shaking the education system of so many States across the globe, often in conjunction with a crisis (already proclaimed in the Communist Manifesto) shaking the family system, takes on a political meaning, given that the School (and the School/Family couple) constitutes the dominant Ideological State Apparatus, the Apparatus playing a determinant part in the reproduction of the relations of production of a mode of production threatened in its existence by the world class struggle. &hellip; </p>
            <p align="center"><strong>Ideology Interpellates Individuals as Subjects  </strong></p>
            <p>This thesis is simply a matter of making my last proposition explicit: there is no ideology except by the subject and for subjects. Meaning, there is no ideology except for concrete subjects, and this destination for ideology is only made possible by the subject: meaning, by the category of the subject and its functioning. &hellip; </p>
            <p>That an individual is always-already a subject, even before he is born, is nevertheless the plain reality, accessible to everyone and not a paradox at all. Freud shows that individuals are always &lsquo;abstract&rsquo; with respect to the subjects they always-already are, simply by noting the ideological ritual that surrounds the expectation of a &lsquo;birth&rsquo;, that &lsquo;happy event&rsquo;. Everyone knows how much and in what way an unborn child is expected. Which amounts to saying, very prosaically, if we agree to drop the &lsquo;sentiments&rsquo;, i.e. the forms of family ideology (paternal/maternal conjugal/fraternal) in which the unborn child is expected: it is certain in advance that it will bear its Father&rsquo;s Name, and will therefore have an identity and be irreplaceable. Before its birth, the child is therefore always-already a subject, appointed as a subject in and by the specific familial ideological configuration in which it is &lsquo;expected&rsquo; once it has been conceived. I hardly need add that this familial ideological configuration is, in its uniqueness, highly structured, and that it is in this implacable and more or less &lsquo;pathological&rsquo; (presupposing that any meaning can be assigned to that term) structure that the former subject to-be will have to &lsquo;find&rsquo; &lsquo;its&rsquo; place, i.e. &lsquo;become&rsquo; the sexual subject (boy or girl) which it already is in advance. It is clear that this ideological constraint and pre-appointment, and all the rituals of rearing and then education in the family, have some relationship with what Freud studied in the forms of the pre-genital and genital &lsquo;stages&rsquo; of sexuality, i.e. in the &lsquo;grip&rsquo; of what Freud registered by its effects as being the unconscious. But let us leave this point, too, on one side. ...</p>
