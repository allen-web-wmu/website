      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#333300">Here 
        are some of the lessons we learned (the hard way) in building our sites. 
        We suggest you use this advice. We're not gurus, but we did learn the 
        trial by fire way and are now branded by our mistakes. We'll spare you 
        the pain.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Don't even think 
        that you can save this project for the week before it is due. You really 
        have to be willing to work-- not only on content but on web-literacy as 
        well. If you commit yourself to it, this site will be a great learning 
        opportunity and you'll use it in the future. If not, it will become one 
        big, frustrating,&quot;this assignment is so dumb&quot; pain in your neck. 
        (And you 'll never use it again...what a shame because it could land you 
        quite the <i>nice</i> job.)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. You're not going 
        to have an epiphany right when you sit down at the computer. Before you 
        even touch a keyboard, review websites that you like (<i>especially design 
        wise</i>). Think extensively about the &quot;look&quot; of your site, 
        and draw it on paper. Make a list of what will go on each page (check 
        the requirements page to see if you've got it all) and decide how you 
        will navigate through your site. Haven't you ever been to a site that 
        you know contains something but you don't know where to go to get it? 
        Don't do that to your visitors!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Spend some time 
        surfing for backgrounds and images relating to your theme. That way you 
        know that what you want is out there. You could spend YEARS searching 
        for bigger and better images, so just resign yourself to the fact that 
        you will never be &quot;done.&quot; Your website is a work in progress.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. Take your drafts 
        to the IT lab in Sangren Hall and they help you master Dreamweaver. This 
        is the ONLY program that the IT lab endorses, so we highly encourage it. 
        You can download Dreamweaver, but only for 30 days. So use your time wisely.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. Have access to 
        a zip disk to make sure all of your info is in one place. If you keep 
        changing your source you'll have to re-link all of the pictures, backgrounds, 
        images, etc. on your site. KEEP INFORMATION ON MORE THAN ONE DISK. Things 
        happen.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6. Get the basics 
        done first. If you spend a ton of time loading pictures onto your personal 
        page, changes are you are neglecting one of the essentials, like your 
        educational philosophy or your parent links.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7. Know what facilities 
        each lab has and when it's open. If you have a simple task to take care 
        of, go to Brown, Khorman, or Haworth. If you need to scan or use special 
        programs, allot yourself specific times in your schedule to go. Oh, and 
        if you are a MAC user you might have to dig a little. Erin found that 
        the Gilmore Theatre Complex is complete with scanners and design equipment, 
        and helpful design majors. You won't just &quot;happen&quot; to have web 
        building time in your schedule. Trust us. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8. Give yourself deadlines. 
        Work on one page at a time, and you'll feel like you are making progress.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9. We recommend using 
        tables--not layers. Our experience is that layers will move in different 
        browsers, ruining the look of your site. You can &quot;convert layers 
        to tables&quot; as a function in Dreamweaver, but it doesn't always work. 
        Layers do have the advantage of allowing you to locate images and text 
        on the page exactly where you want it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10. When scanning 
        pictures, always make sure the resolution is 72. Also, enter in your destination 
        size before you scan so that all of your pictures will be uniform, and 
        you won't have to resize and distort them in your design program. This 
        gives pictures that pixelized look--boo. Photoshop has a nice &quot;save 
        for the web&quot; featuer that allows you to preview how your images will 
        look before you save them and also set them at a size that will download 
        quickly. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11. If you create 
        images in Adobe Illustrator, make sure you are using &quot;web-colors.&quot; 
        This limits your options significantly, and you don't want to get too 
        attached to an image and find out it won't load. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12. Be as prepared 
        as you can when coming to campus to work. Have everything drawn, written, 
        and saved to disk so all you have to do is enter it into Dreamweaver. 
        Don't waste your time in the IT lab searching for backgrounds. This will 
        really piss off the people waiting for real help.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13. Even if you come 
        prepared, you are going to be amazed at the amount of time it takes to 
        put this all together. Plan on AT LEAST 4 hours per page.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14. BEG, BORROW, and 
        STEAL. Use Allen's site, other teacher/professor's sites, and other students' 
        sites to get great links and ideas. BUT be sure to give credit where credit 
        is due. Stealing designs, backgrounds, images is illegal and rude. We 
        don't condone meanies.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15. Do as much as 
        you can early in the semester. The IT lab gets REALLY busy toward the 
        end of the semester due to the abundance of procrastination at this university. 
        Don't be a slacker.</font></p>
