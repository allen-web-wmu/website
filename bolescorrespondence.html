<p align="center"><strong>EDUCATION AND PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT:  THE LONG SHADOW OF WORK</strong></p>
<p><em></em></p><blockquote><blockquote><em>Every child born into the 
world should be looked upon by society as so much raw material to be 
manufactured.  Its quality is to be 			tested.  It is the business of 
society, as an intelligent economist, to make the best of it.<p></p>

<p>...In our view, it is pointless to ask if the net effect of U.S. 
  education is to promote equality or inequality, repression or 
  liberation. These issues pale into insignificance before the major fact:
  The educational system is an integral element in the reproduction of 
  the prevailing class structure of society. The educational system 
  certainly has a life of its own, but the experience of work and the 
  nature of the class structure are the bases upon which educational 
  values are formed, social justice assessed, the realm of the possible 
  delineated in people's consciousness, and the social relations of the 
educational encounter historically transformed. </p>
<p>In short, and to return to a persistent theme of this book, the 
  educational system's task of integrating young people into adult work 
  roles constrains the types of personal development which it can foster 
  in ways that are antithetical to the fulfillment of its personal 
developmental function.</p>

<blockquote>e e cummings, 1940</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></em><p></p> 
<p>Economic life exhibits a complex and relatively stable pattern of 
power and property relationships. The perpetuation of these social 
relationships, even over relatively short periods, is by no means 
automatic. As with a living organism, stability in the economic sphere 
is the result of explicit mechanisms constituted to maintain and extend 
the dominant patterns of power and privilege. We call the sum total of 
these mechanisms and their actions the reproduction process. </p>
<p>Amidst the sundry social relations experienced in daily life, a few 
stand out as central to our analysis of education. These are precisely 
the social relationships which are necessary to the security of 
capitalist profits and the stability of the capitalist division of 
labor. They include the patterns of dominance and subordinacy in the 
production process, the distribution of ownership of productive 
resources, and the degrees of social distance and solidarity among 
various fragments of the working population-men and women, blacks and 
whites, and white-and blue-collar workers, to mention some of the most 
salient. </p>
<p>What are the mechanisms of reproduction of these aspects of the 
social relations of production in the United States? To an extent, 
stability is embodied in law and backed by the coercive power of the 
state. Our jails are filled with individuals who have operated outside 
the framework of the private-ownership market system. The modern urban 
police force as well as the National Guard originated, in large part, in
 response to the fear of social upheaval evoked by militant labor 
action. Legal sanction, within the framework of the laws of private 
property, also channels the actions of groups (e.g., unions) into 
conformity with dominant power relationships.  Similarly, force is used 
to stabilize the division of labor and its rewards within an enterprise:
 Dissenting workers are subject to dismissal and directors failing to 
conform to "capitalist rationality" will be replaced. </p>
<p>But to attribute reproduction to force alone borders on the absurd. 
Under normal conditions, the effectiveness of coercion depends at the 
very least on the inability or unwillingness of those subjected to it to
 join together in opposing it. Laws generally considered illegitimate 
tend to lose their coercive power, and undisguised force too frequently 
applied tends to be self-defeating. The consolidation and extension of 
capitalism has engendered struggles of furious intensity. Yet instances 
of force deployed against a united and active opposition are sporadic 
and have usually given way to détente in one form or another through a 
combination of compromise, structural change, and ideological 
accommodation. Thus it is clear that the consciousness of 
workers-beliefs, values, self-concepts, types of solidarity and 
fragmentation, as well as modes of personal behavior and development-are
 integral to the perpetuation, validation, and smooth operation of 
economic institutions. The reproduction of the social relations of 
production depends on the reproduction of consciousness. </p>
<p>Under what conditions will individuals accept the pattern of social 
relationships that frame their lives? Believing that the long-term 
development of the existing system holds the prospect of fulfilling 
their needs, individuals and groups might actively embrace these social 
relationships. Failing this, and lacking a vision of an alternative that
 might significantly improve their situation, they might fatalistically 
accept their condition. Even with such a vision they might passively 
submit to the framework of economic life and seek individual solutions 
to social problems if they believe that the possibilities for realizing 
change are remote. The issue of the reproduction of consciousness enters
 each of these assessments. </p>
<p>The economic system will be embraced when, first, the perceived needs
 of individuals are congruent with the types of satisfaction the 
economic system can objectively provide. While perceived needs may be, 
in part, biologically determined, for the most part needs arise through 
the aggregate experiences of individuals in the society. Thus the social
 relations of production are reproduced in part through a harmony 
between the needs which the social system generates and the means at its
 disposal for satisfying these needs. </p>
<p>Second, the view that fundamental social change is not feasible, 
unoperational, and utopian is normally supported by a complex web of 
ideological perspectives deeply embedded in the cultural and scientific 
life of the community and reflected in the consciousness of its members.
 But fostering the "consciousness of inevitability" is not the office of
 the cultural system alone. There must also exist mechanisms that 
systematically thwart the spontaneous development of social experiences 
that would contradict these beliefs. </p>
<p>Belief in the futility of organizing for fundamental social change is
 further facilitated by social distinctions which fragment the 
conditions of life for subordinate classes. The strategy of "divide and 
conquer" has enabled dominant classes to maintain their power since the 
dawn of civilization. Once again, the splintered consciousness of a 
subordinate class is not the product of cultural phenomena alone, but 
must be reproduced through the experiences of daily life. </p>
<p>Consciousness develops through the individual's direct perception of 
and participation in social life. Indeed, everyday experience itself 
often acts as an inertial stabilizing force. For instance, when the 
working population is effectively stratified, individual needs and 
self-concepts develop in a 
correspondingly fragmented manner. Youth of different racial, sexual, 
ethnic, or economic characteristics directly perceive the economic 
positions and prerogatives of "their kind of people." By adjusting their
 aspiration accordingly, they not only reproduce stratification on the 
level of personal consciousness, but bring their needs into (at least 
partial) harmony with the fragmented conditions of economic life. 
Similarly, individuals tend to channel the development of their personal
 powers--cognitive, emotional, physical, aesthetic, and spiritual-in 
directions where they will have an opportunity to exercise them. Thus 
the alienated character of work, for example, leads people to guide 
their creative potentials to areas outside of economic activity: 
consumption, travel, sexuality, and family life. So needs and 
need-satisfaction again tend to fall into congruence and alienated labor
 is reproduced on the level of personal consciousness.</p>
<p>But this congruence is continually disrupted. For the satisfaction of
 needs gives rise to new needs. These new needs derive from the logic of
 personal development as well as from the evolving structure of material
 life, and in turn undercut the reproduction of consciousness. For this 
reason the reproduction of consciousness cannot be the simple unintended
 by-product of social experience. Rather, social relationships must be 
consciously organized to facilitate the reproduction of consciousness. </p>
<p>Take, for instance, the organization of the capitalist enterprise 
discussed in Chapter 3. Power relations and hiring criteria within the 
enterprise are 
organized so as to reproduce the workers' self-concepts, the legitimacy 
of their assignments within the hierarchy, a sense of the technological 
inevitability of the hierarchical division of labor itself, and the 
social distance among groups of workers in the organization. Indeed, 
while token gestures towards workers' self-management may be a 
successful motivational gimmick, any delegation of real power to workers
 becomes a threat to profits because it tends to undermine patterns of 
consciousness compatible with capitalist control. By generating new 
needs and possibilities, by demonstrating the feasibility of a more 
thoroughgoing economic democracy, by increasing worker solidarity, an 
integrated and politically conscious program of worker involvement in 
decision-making may undermine the power structure of the enterprise. 
Management will accede to such changes only under extreme duress of 
worker rebellion and rapidly disintegrating morale, if at all. </p>
<p>But the reproduction of consciousness cannot be insured by these 
direct mechanisms alone. The initiation of youth into the economic 
system is further facilitated by a series of institutions, including the
 family and the educational system, that are more immediately related to
 the formation of personality and consciousness. Education works 
primarily through the institutional relations to which students are 
subjected. Thus schooling fosters and rewards the development of certain
 capacities and the expression of certain needs, while thwarting and 
penalizing others. Through these institutional relationships, the 
educational system tailors the self-concepts, aspirations,
and social class identifications of individuals to the requirements of 
the social division of labor. </p>
<p>The extent to which the educational system actually accomplishes 
these objectives varies considerably from one period to the next. We 
shall see in later chapters that recurrently through U.S. history these 
reproduction mechanisms have failed, sometimes quite spectacularly. In 
most periods-and the present is certainly no exception-efforts to use 
the schools to reproduce and extend capitalist production relations have
 been countered both by the internal dynamic of the educational system 
and by popular opposition. </p>
<p>In earlier chapters we have identified the two main objectives of 
dominant classes in educational policy: the production of labor power 
and the reproduction of those institutions and social relationships 
which facilitate the translation of labor power into profits. We may now
 be considerably more concrete about the way that educational 
institutions are structured to meet these objectives. First, schooling 
produces many of the technical and cognitive skills required for 
adequate job performance. Second, the educational system helps 
legitimate economic inequality. As we argued in the last chapter, the 
objective and meritocratic orientation of U.S. education, reduces 
discontent over both the hierarchical division of labor and the process 
through which individuals attain position in it. Third, the school 
produces, rewards, and labels personal characteristics relevant to the 
staffing of positions in the hierarchy. Fourth, the educational system, 
through the pattern of status distinctions it fosters, reinforces the 
stratified consciousness on which the fragmentation of subordinate 
economic classes is based. </p>
<p>What aspects of the educational system allow it to serve these 
various functions? We shall suggest in the next section that the 
educational system's ability to reproduce the consciousness of workers 
lies in a straight-forward correspondence principle: For the past 
century at least, schooling has contributed to the reproduction of the 
social relations of production largely through the correspondence 
between school and class structure. </p>
<p>Upon the slightest reflection, this assertion is hardly surprising. 
All major institutions in a "stable" social system will direct personal 
development in a direction compatible with its reproduction. Of course, 
this is not, in itself, a critique of capitalism or of U.S. education. 
In any conceivable society, individuals are forced to develop their 
capacities in one direction or another. The idea of a social system 
which merely allows people to develop freely according to their "inner 
natures" is quite unthinkable, since human nature only acquires a 
concrete form through the interaction of the physical world and 
preestablished social relationships. </p>
<p>Our critique of education and other aspects of human development in 
the United States fully recognizes the necessity of some form of 
socialization. The critical question is: What for? In the United States 
the human development experience is dominated by an undemocratic, 
irrational, and exploitative economic structure. Young people have no 
recourse from the requirements of the system but a life of poverty, 
dependence, and economic insecurity. Our critique, not surprisingly, 
centers on the structure of jobs. In the U.S. economy work has become a 
fact of life to which individuals must by and large submit and over 
which they have no control. Like the weather, work "happens" to people. A
 liberated, participatory, democratic, and creative alternative can 
hardly be imagined, much less experienced. Work under capitalism is an 
alienated activity. </p>
<p>To reproduce the social relations of production, the educational 
system must try to teach people to be property subordinate and render 
them sufficiently fragmented in consciousness to preclude their getting 
together to shape their own material existence. The forms of 
consciousness and behavior fostered by the educational system must 
themselves be alienated, in the sense that they conform neither to the 
dictates of technology in the struggle with nature, nor to the inherent 
developmental capacities of individuals, but rather to the needs of the 
capitalist class. It is the prerogatives of capital and the imperatives 
of profit, not human capacities and technical realities, which render 
U.S. schooling what it is. This is our charge. </p>
<p><em>The Correspondence Principle</em></p> 
<p><em></em></p><blockquote><blockquote><em>In the social production 
which men carry on they enter into definite relations which are 
indispensable and independent of their will; . . . The sum total of 
these relations of production constitutes . . . the real foundation on 
which rise legal and political superstructures, and to which correspond 
definite forms of social consciousness. <br>
<blockquote>KARL MARX, <br>
Contribution to a Critique of Political Economy, 1857 </blockquote></em></blockquote></blockquote><p></p>
<p>The educational system helps integrate youth into the economic 
system, we believe, through a structural correspondence between its 
social relations and those of production. The structure of social 
relations in education not only inures the student to the discipline of 
the work place, but develops the types of personal demeanor, modes of 
self-presentation, self-image, and social-class identifications which 
are the crucial ingredients of job adequacy. Specifically, the social 
relationships of education-the relationships between administrators and 
teachers, teachers and students, students and students, and students and
 their work-replicate the hierarchical division of labor. Hierarchical 
relations are reflected in the vertical authority lines from 
administrators to teachers to students. Alienated labor is reflected in 
the student's lack of control over his or her education, the alienation 
of the student from the curriculum content, and the motivation of school
 work through a system of grades and other external rewards rather than 
the student's integration with either the process (learning) or the 
outcome (knowledge) of the educational "production process." 
Fragmentation in work is reflected in the institutionalized and often 
destructive competition among students through continual and ostensibly 
meritocratic ranking and evaluation. By attuning young people to a set 
of social relationships similar to those of the work place, schooling 
attempts to gear the development of personal needs to its requirements. 
</p><p>But the correspondence of schooling with the social relations of 
production goes beyond this aggregate level. Different levels of 
education feed workers into different levels within the occupational 
structure and, correspondingly, tend toward an internal organization 
comparable to levels in the hierarchical division of labor. As we have 
seen, the lowest levels in the hierarchy of the enterprise emphasize 
rule-following, middle levels, dependability, and the capacity to 
operate without direct and continuous supervision while the higher 
levels stress the internalization of the norms of the enterprise. 
Similarly, in education, lower levels (junior and senior high school) 
tend to severely limit and channel the activities of students. Somewhat 
higher up the educational ladder, teacher and community colleges allow 
for more independent activity and less overall supervision. At the top, 
the elite four-year colleges emphasize social relationships conformable 
with the higher levels in the production hierarchy. Thus schools 
continually maintain their hold on students. As they "master" one type 
of behavioral regulation, they are either allowed to progress to the 
next or are channeled into the corresponding level in the hierarchy of 
production. Even within a single school, the social relationships of 
different tracks tend to conform to different behavioral norms. Thus in 
high school, vocational and general tracks emphasize rule-following and 
close supervision, while the college track tends toward a more open 
atmosphere emphasizing the internalization of norms. 
</p><p>These differences in the social relationships among and within 
schools, in part, reflect both the social backgrounds of the student 
body and their likely future economic positions. Thus blacks and other 
minorities are concentrated in schools whose repressive, arbitrary, 
generally chaotic internal order, coercive authority structures, and 
minimal possibilities for advancement mirror the characteristics of 
inferior job situations. Similarly, predominantly working-class schools 
tend to emphasize behavioral control and rule-following, while schools 
in well-to-do suburbs employ relatively open systems that favor greater 
student participation, less direct supervision, more student electives, 
and, in general, a value system stressing internalized standards of 
control. 
</p><p>The differential socialization patterns of schools attended by 
students of different social classes do not arise by accident. Rather, 
they reflect the fact that the educational objectives and expectations 
of administrators, teachers, and parents (as well as the responsiveness 
of students to various patterns of teaching and control) differ for 
students of different social classes. At crucial turning points in the 
history of U.S. education, changes in the social relations of schooling 
have been dictated in the interests of a more harmonious reproduction of
 the class structure. But in the day-to-day operation of the schools, 
the consciousness of different occupational strata, derived from their 
cultural milieu and work experience, is crucial to the maintenance of 
the correspondences we have described. That working-class parents seem 
to favor stricter educational methods is a reflection of their own work 
experiences, which have demonstrated that submission to authority is an 
essential ingredient in one's ability to get and hold a steady, 
well-paying job. That professional and self-employed parents prefer a 
more open atmosphere and a greater emphasis on motivational control is 
similarly a reflection of their position in the social division of 
labor. When given the opportunity, higher-status parents are far more 
likely than their lower-status neighbors to choose "open classrooms" for
 their children. 
</p><p>Differences in the social relationships of schooling are further 
reinforced by inequalities in financial resources. The paucity of 
financial support for the education of children from minority groups and
 low-income families leaves more resources to be devoted to the children
 of those with more commanding roles in the economy; it also forces upon
 the teachers and school administrators in the working-class schools a 
type of social relationships that fairly closely mirrors that of the 
factory. Financial considerations in poorly supported schools militate 
against small intimate classes, multiple elective courses, and 
specialized teachers (except for disciplinary personnel). They preclude 
the amounts of free time for teachers and free space required for a more
 open, flexible educational environment. The well-financed schools 
attended by the children of the rich can offer much greater 
opportunities for the development of the capacity for sustained 
independent work and all the other characteristics required for adequate
 job performance in the upper levels of the occupational hierarchy. 
</p><p>Much of this description will most likely be familiar to the 
reader and has been documented many times. But only recently has there 
been an attempt at statistical verification. We will review a number of 
excellent studies, covering both higher and secondary education. Jeanne 
Binstock investigated the different patterns of social relations of 
higher education by analyzing the college handbooks covering rules, 
regulations, and norms of fifty-two public junior colleges, state 
universities, teacher-training colleges, and private, secular, 
denominational, and Catholic colleges. Binstock rated each school along a
 host of dimensions, including the looseness or strictness of academic 
structure, the extent of regulations governing personal and social 
conduct, and the degree of control of the students over their cultural 
affairs and extracurricular activities high. Her general conclusion is 
quite simple:
</p><p></p><blockquote>The major variations of college experiences are 
linked to basic 	psychological differences in work perception and 
aspiration among the 	major social class (occupational) groups who are 
its major consumers. Each 	social class is different in its beliefs as 
to which technical and 	interpersonal skills, character traits, and work
 values are most valuable 	for economic survival (stability) or to gain 
economic advantage 	(mobility). Each class (with subvariations based on 
religion and level of 	urbanness) has its own economic consciousness, 
based on its own work 	experiences and its own ideas (correct or not) of
 the expectations 	appropriate to positions on the economic ladder above
 their own. . . . 	Colleges compete over the various social class 
markets by specializing 	their offerings. Each different type of 
undergraduate college survives by 	providing circumscribed sets of 
"soft" and "hard" skill training that 	generally corresponds both to the
 expectations of a particular social 	class group of customers and to 
specific needs for sets of "soft" and 	"hard" skills at particular 
layers of the industrial system.</blockquote>
<p>Binstock isolated several organizational traits consistently related 
to the various educational institutions she studied. First, she 
distinguished between behavioral control which involves rules over the 
student's behavior rather than intentions and stresses external 
compliance rather than internalized norms, and motivational control 
which emphasizes unspecified, variable, and highly flexible 
task-orientation, and seeks to promote value systems that stress 
ambiguity and innovation over certainty, tradition, and conformity. 
Second, Binstock isolated a leader-versus-follower orientation with some
 schools stressing the future subordinate positions of its charges and 
teaching docility, and others stressing the need to develop "leadership"
 self-concepts. 
</p><p>Binstock found that institutions that enroll working-class 
students and are geared to staff lower-level jobs in the production 
hierarchy emphasize followership and behavioral control, while the more 
elite schools that tend to staff the higher-level jobs emphasize 
leadership and motivational control. Her conclusion is: 
</p><p></p><blockquote>Although constantly in the process of 
reformation, the college industry 	remains a ranked hierarchy of goals 
and practices, responding to social 	class pressures, with graded access
 to the technical equipment, 	organizational skills, emotional 
perspectives and class (work) values 	needed for each stratified level 
of the industrial systems. </blockquote>
<p>The evidence for the correspondence between the social relations of 
production and education, however, goes well beyond this structural 
level and also sheds light on the commonality of motivational patterns 
fostered by these two spheres of social life. Juxtaposing the recent 
research of Gene Smith, Richard Edwards, Peter Meyer, and ourselves, the
 same types of behavior can be shown to be rewarded in both education 
and work. In an attempt to quantify aspects of personality and 
motivation, Gene Smith has employed a relatively sensitive testing 
procedure, which he has shown in a series of well-executed studies" to 
be an excellent predictor of educational success (grade-point average). 
Noting that personality inventories traditionally suffer because of 
their abstraction from real life environments and their use of a single 
evaluative instrument. Smith turned to student-peer ratings of forty-two
 common personality traits, based on each student's observation of the 
actual classroom behavior of his or her classmates. A statistical 
technique called factor analysis then allowed for the identification of 
five general traits-agreeableness, extroversion, work orientation, 
emotionality and helpfulness-that proved stable across different 
samples. Of these five traits, only the work-orientation factor, which 
Smith calls "strength of character"-including such traits as ". . . not a
 quitter, conscientious, responsible, insistently orderly, not prone to 
daydreaming, determined, persevering . . ."-was related to school 
success. Smith then proceeded to show that, in several samples, this 
work-orientation trait was three times more successful in predicting 
post-high-school academic performance than any combination of thirteen 
cognitive variables, including SAT verbal, SAT mathematical, and school 
class rank. 
</p><p>Our colleague Richard C. Edwards has further refined Smith's 
procedure. As part of his Ph.D. dissertation on the nature of the 
hierarchical division of labor, he prepared a set of sixteen pairs of 
personality measures relevant to work performance. Edwards argued that 
since supervisor ratings of employees are a basic determinant of 
hirings, firings, and promotions, they are the best measure of job 
adequacy and, indeed, are the implements of the organization's 
motivational system. Edwards, therefore, compared supervisor ratings of 
worker performance with the set of sixteen personality measures as rated
 by the workers' peers. In a sample of several hundred Boston area 
workers, he found a cluster of three personality traits -summarized as 
rules orientation, dependability, and internationalization of the norms 
of the firm-strongly predicting supervisor ratings of workers in the 
same work group. This result, moreover, holds up even when the 
correlation of these traits with such attributes as age, sex, social 
class background, education, and IQ is corrected for by linear 
regression analysis. In conformance with our analysis in Chapter 3, 
Edwards found that rules orientation was relatively more important at 
the lowest levels of the hierarchy of production, internalization of 
norms was predominant at the highest level, while dependability was 
salient at intermediate levels. 
</p><p>Edwards' success with this test in predicting supervisor ratings 
of workers convinced us that applying the same forms to high school 
students would provide a fairly direct link between personality 
development in school and the requirements of job performance. 
</p><p>This task we carried out with our colleague Peter Meyer. He chose
 as his sample the 237 members of the senior class of a single New York 
State high school. Following Edwards, he created sixteen pairs of 
personality traits, and obtained individual grade-point averages, IQ 
scores, and college-entrance-examination SAT-verbal and SAT-mathematical
 scores from the official school records. 
</p><p>As we expected, the cognitive scores provided the best single 
predictor of grade-point average-indeed, that grading is based 
significantly on cognitive performance is perhaps the most valid element
 in the "meritocratic ideology." But the sixteen personality measures 
possessed nearly comparable predictive value, having a multiple 
correlation of 0.63 compared to 0.77 for the cognitive variables. More 
important than the overall predictive value of the personality traits, 
however, was the pattern of their contribution to grades. To reveal this
 pattern, we first eliminated the effect of differences in cognitive 
performance in individual grades and then calculated the correlation 
between grades and the personality traits. The results are presented in 
Figure 5-1. 
</p><p>The pattern of resulting associations clearly supports the 
correspondence principle and strongly replicates our initial empirical 
study of grading presented in Chapter 2. The only significant penalized 
traits are precisely those which are incompatible with conformity to the
 hierarchical division of labor-creativity, independence, and 
aggressivity. On the other hand, all the personality traits which we 
would expect to be rewarded are, and significantly so. Finally, a glance
 at Figure 5-2 shows a truly remarkable correspondence between the 
personality traits rewarded or penalized by grades in Myer's study and 
the pattern of traits which Edwards found indicative of high or low 
supervisor ratings in industry. 
</p><p>As a second stage in our analysis of Meyer's data, we used factor
 analysis to consolidate the sixteen personality measures into three 
"personality factors." Factor analysis allows us to group together those
 measured traits which are normally associated with one another among 
all individuals in the sample. The first factor, which we call 
"submission to authority," includes these traits: consistent, identifies
 with school, punctual, dependable, externally motivated, and 
persistent. In addition, it includes independent and creative weighted 
negatively. The second, which we call temperament, includes: not 
aggressive, not temperamental, not frank, predictable, tactful, and not 
creative. The third we call internalized control, and it includes: 
empathizes orders and defers gratification.

<p>These three factors are not perfectly comparable to Edwards' three 
factors. Thus our submission to authority seems to combine Edwards' 
rules and dependability factors, while our internalized control is 
comparable to Edwards' internalization factor. In the case of the 
latter, both Edwards and Myer's data depict an individual who 
sensitively interprets the desires his or her superior and operates 
adequately without direct supervision over considerable periods of time.
 </p>
<p>Our theory would predict that at the high school level submission to 
authority would be the best predictor of grades among personality 
traits, while internalization would be less important. (The temperament 
factor is essentially irrelevant to our theory and might be expected to 
be unimportant.) This prediction was confirmed. Assessing the 
independent contributions of both cognitive measures and personality 
factors to the prediction of grades, we found that SAT math were the 
most important, followed by submission to authority and SAT-verbal 
scores (each equally important). Internalized control proved to be 
significantly less important as predictors. The temperament and IQ 
variables made no independent contribution.</p>

<p>Thus, at least for this sample, the personality traits rewarded in 
schools seem to be rather similar to those indicative of good job 
performance in the capitalist economy. Since moreover both Edwards and 
Meyer used essentially the same measures of personality traits, we can 
test this assertion in yet another way. We can take the three general 
traits extracted by Edwards in his study of workers-rules orientation, 
dependability, and internalization of norms-and find the relationship 
between those traits and grades in Myer's school study. The results 
shown in Figure 5-3, exhibit a remarkable congruence.</p>

<p>While the correspondence principle stands up well in the light of 
grading practices, we must stress that the empirical data on grading 
must not regarded as fully revealing the inner workings of the 
educational system's reproduction of the social division of labor. In 
the first place, it is the overall structure of social relations of the 
educational encounter which reproduces consciousness, not just grading 
practices. Nor are personality traits the only relevant personal 
attributes captured in this data; others are modes of 
self-presentation, self-image, aspirations, and class identifications. 
The measuring of personality traits moreover is complex and difficult, 
and these studies probably capture only a small part of the relevant 
dimensions. Finally, both traits rewarded in schools and relevant to job
 performance differ by educational level, class composition of schools, 
and the student's particular educational track. These subtleties are not
 reflected in this data. </p>
<p>For all these reasons, we would not expect student grades to be a 
good predictor of economic success. In addition, grades are clearly 
dominated by the cognitive performance of students, which we have seen 
is not highly relevant to economic success. Still, we might expect that 
in an adequately controlled study in which work performances of 
individuals on the same job and with comparable educational experience 
are compared, grades will be good predictors. We have managed to find 
only one study even approaching these requirements-a study which clearly
 supports our position, and is sufficiently interesting to present in 
some detail. Marshall S. Brenner studied one hundred employees who had 
joined the Lockheed-California Company after obtaining a high school 
diploma in the Los Angeles City school districts. From the employees' 
high school transcripts, he obtained their grade-point averages, school 
absence rates, a teachers' "work habits" evaluation, and a teachers' 
"cooperation" evaluation. In addition to this data, he gathered three 
evaluations of job performance by employees' supervisors: a supervisors'
 "ability rating," "conduct rating," and "productivity rating." Brenner 
found a significant correlation between grades and all measures of 
supervisor evaluation. </p>
<p>We have reanalyzed Brenner's data to uncover the source of this 
correlation. One possibility is that grades measure cognitive 
performance and cognitive performance determines job performance. 
However, when the high school teachers' work habits and cooperation 
evaluations as well as school absences were controlled for by linear 
regression, grades had no power to predict either worker conduct or 
worker productivity. Hence, we may draw two conclusions: First, grades 
predict job adequacy only through their noncognitive component; and 
second, teachers' evaluations of behavior in the classroom are 
strikingly similar to supervisors' ratings of behavior on the job. The 
cognitive component of grades predicts only the supervisors' ability 
rating-which is not surprising in view of the probability that both are 
related to employee IQ.</p>
<p>Why then the association between more schooling and higher incomes? 
In Chapter 3, we indicated the importance of four sets of noncognitive 
worker traits-work-related personality characteristics, modes of 
self-presentation, racial, sexual, and ethnic characteristics, and 
credentials. We believe that all of these traits are involved in the 
association between educational level and economic success. We have 
already shown how personality traits conducive to performance at 
different hierarchical levels are fostered and rewarded by the school 
system. A similar, but simpler, argument can be made with respect to 
modes of 
self-presentation. Individuals who have attained a certain educational 
level tend to identify with one another socially and to differentiate 
themselves from their "inferiors." They tend to adjust their aspirations
 and self-concepts accordingly, while acquiring manners of speech and 
demeanor more or less socially acceptable and appropriate to their 
level. As such, they are correspondingly valuable to employers 
interested in preserving and reproducing the status differences on which
 the legitimacy and stability of the hierarchical division of labor is 
based. Moreover, insofar as educational credentials are an independent 
determinant of hiring and promotion, they will directly account for a 
portion of this association. </p>
<p>Finally, family background also accounts for a significant portion of
 the association between schooling and economic attainment. Indeed, for 
white males, about a third of the correlation between education and 
income is due to the common association of both variables with 
socioeconomic background, even holding constant childhood IQ.  That is, 
people whose parents have higher-status economic positions tend to 
achieve more income themselves independent of their education, but they 
also tend to get more education. Hence the observed association is 
reinforced. 
Indeed, there is a strong independent association between family 
background and economic success, illustrated in Figure 5-4. For the 
large national sample represented there, children of the poorest tenth 
of families have roughly a third the likelihood of winding up well-off 
as the children of the most well-to-do tenth, even if they have the same
 educational attainments and childhood IQ's. What is the origin of this 
effect? The inheritance of wealth, family connections, and other more or
 less direct advantages play an important role here. But there are more 
subtle if no less important influences at work here as well. We shall 
argue in the following section that the experiences of parents on the 
job tend to be reflected in the social relations of family life. Thus, 
through family socialization, children tend to acquire orientations 
toward work, aspirations, and self-concepts, preparing them for similar 
economic positions themselves. </p>

<p>...Kohn then went on to investigate the impact of work-related 
values on 
child-rearing. He began, in 1956, with a sample of 339 white mothers of 
children in the fifth grade, whose husbands held middle-class and 
working-class jobs. He inquired into the values parents would most like 
to see in their children's behavior. He found that parents of 
lower-status children value obedience, neatness, and honesty in their 
children, while higher-status parents emphasize curiosity, self-control,
 consideration, and happiness. The fathers of these children who were 
interviewed showed a similar pattern of values. Kohn says: </p>
<p></p><blockquote>Middle class parents are more likely to emphasize 
children's 
self-	direction, and working class parents to emphasize their conformity
 to external authority.... The essential difference between the terms, 
as we use them, is that self-direction focuses on internal standards of 
direction for behavior; conformity focuses on externally imposed rules. </blockquote><p></p>
<p>Kohn further emphasized that these values translate directly into 
corresponding authority relationships between parents and children, with
 higher-status parents punishing breakdowns of internalized norms, and 
lower-status parents punishing transgressions of rules: </p>
<p></p><blockquote>The principal difference between the classes is in 
the specific conditions 	under which parents-particularly mothers-punish
 children's misbehavior. 	Working class parents are more likely to 
punish or refrain from punishing 	on the basis of the direct and 
immediate consequences of children's 	actions, middle class parents on 
the basis of their interpretation of 	children's intent in acting as 
they do.... If self-direction is valued, 	transgressions must be judged 
in terms of the reasons why the children 	misbehave. If conformity is 
valued, transgressions must be judged in terms 	of whether or not the 
actions violate externally imposed proscriptions.</blockquote><p></p>
<p>In 1964, Kohn undertook to validate his findings with a national 
sample of 3,100 males, representative of the employed, male civilian 
labor force. His results clearly support his earlier interpretation: 
Higher-job-status fathers prefer consideration, curiosity, 
responsibility, and self-control in their children; low-status fathers 
prefer good manners, neatness, honesty, and obedience. Moreover, Kohn 
showed that about two-thirds of these social status-related differences 
are directly related to the extent of occupational self-direction. As a 
predictor of child-rearing values, the structure of work life clearly 
overshadows the other correlates of status such as occupational prestige
 or educational level. He concludes: </p>
<p></p><blockquote>Whether consciously or not parents tend to impact to 
their children 	lessons derived from the conditions of life of their own
 social class-and 	this helps to prepare their children for a similar 
class position.... 	Class differences in parental values and child 
rearing practices influence 	the development of the capacities that 
children will someday need.... 	The family, then, functions as a 
mechanism for perpetuating inequality.</blockquote><p></p>
<p>Kohn's analysis provides a careful and compelling elucidation of one 
facet of what we consider to be a generalized social phenomenon: the 
reflection of economic life in all major spheres of social activity. The
 hierarchical division of labor, with the fragmentation of the work 
force which it engenders, is merely reflected in family life. The 
distinct quality of social relationships at different hierarchical 
levels in production are reflected in corresponding social relationships
 in the family. Families, in turn, reproduce the forms of consciousness 
required for the integration of a new generation into the economic 
system. Such differential patterns of child-rearing affect more than the
 worker's personality, as is exemplified in Kohn's study. They also 
pattern 
self-concepts, personal aspirations, styles of self-presentation, class 
loyalties, and modes of speech, dress, and inter-personal behavior. 
While such traits are by no means fixed into adulthood and must be 
reinforced at the workplace, their stability over the life cycle appears
 sufficient to account for a major portion of the observed degree of 
intergenerational status transmission. </p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p><em>

CAT STEVENS </blockquote></em><p></p>
<p>The economic system is stable only if the consciousness of the strata
 and classes which compose it remains compatible with the social 
relations which characterize it as a mode of production. The 
perpetuation of the class structure requires that the hierarchical 
division of labor be reproduced in the consciousness of its 
participants. The educational system is one of the several reproduction 
mechanisms through which dominant elites seek to achieve this objective.
 By providing skills, legitimating inequalities in economic positions, 
and facilitating certain types of social intercourse among individuals, 
U.S. education patterns personal development around the requirements of 
alienated work. The educational system reproduces the capitalist social 
division of labor, in part, through a correspondence between its own 
internal social relationships and those of the workplace. The tendency 
of the social relationships of economic life to be replicated in the 
educational system and in family life lies at the heart of the failure 
of the liberal educational creed. This fact must form the basis of a 
viable program for social change. Patterns of inequality, repression, 
and forms of class domination cannot be restricted to a single sphere of
 life, but reappear in substantially altered, yet structurally 
comparable, form in all spheres. Power and privilege in economic life 
surface not only in the core social institutions which pattern the 
formation of consciousness (e.g., school and family), but even in 
face-to-face personal encounters, leisure activities, cultural life, 
sexual relationships, and philosophies of the world. In particular, the 
liberal goal of employing the educational system as a corrective device 
for overcoming the "inadequacies" of the economic system is vain indeed.
 We will argue in our concluding chapter that the transformation of the 
educational system and the pattern of class relationships, power, and 
privilege in the economic sphere must go hand in hand as part of an 
integrated program for action. </p>
<p>To speak of social change is to speak of making history.  Thus we are
 motivated to look into the historical roots of the present educational 
system in order to better understand the framework within which social 
change takes place. Our major question will be: What were the historical
 forces giving rise to the present correspondence between education and 
economic life and how have these been affected by changes in the class 
structure and by concrete people's struggles? How may we shape these 
forces so as to serve the goals of economic equality and liberated human
 development? </p>
<p>We shall show that the historical development of the educational 
system reflects a counterpoint of reproduction and contradiction. As we 
have already seen, capitalist economic development leads to continual 
shifts in the social relationships of production and the attendant class
 structure. These social relationships have involved class conflicts 
which, throughout U.S. history. have periodically changed in both form 
and content. In important respects the educational system has served to 
defuse and attenuate these conflicts. Thus the changing character of 
social conflict, rooted in shifts in the class structure and in other 
relations of power and privilege has resulted in periodic 
reorganizations of educational institutions. At the same time the 
educational system has evolved in ways which intensify and politicize 
the basic contradictions and conflicts of capitalist society. </p><font size="4"><address></address><p></p>
