        <p align="left">At the time scheduled for the final  I will post 3 of the following questions on the board.  You will have 2 hours to write on 2 of the 3 questions.</p>
        <p align="left">Your answer should show a deep and thoughtful understanding of the topic and significantly address and analyze the texts named in the question.  You are also encouraged to refer to additional texts, films, and speakers that we have encountered (a complete list is below) to flesh out or elaborate your points. I recommend that you use the full time allowed and make your answers as complete as possible.</p>
        <p align="left">The test is closed book and no notes. Bring blank paper and a pencil or pen.</p>
        <p align="left">I strongly encourage you to work with other students to prepare for this test.  I think preparing for the exam you will see that we have learned a tremendous amount in this class, and that studying for the final can actually be intellectually exciting and, even, fun!</p>
