            <div align="left">Carefully examine the list of literary works in the area your group has chosen, select the equivalent of at least two  novel-length (200-300 pages) works. Choose works that you think you would enjoy, that would help you better understand life in the area under study, and/or that might appeal to younger readers. Novels, short stories, plays, poetry, graphic novels, are all appropriate choices. Verify with group members that there is no overlap in your selections. Check works out from the library or purchase and begin reading as soon as possible. If the work is not appealing to you, drop it, and start one that you enjoy. Your decision-making will be the basis of the book that will go to hundreds of teachers and, thus, thousands of students.</div>
