            <p>Good friends, my Readers, who peruse this Book,<br>
              Be not offended, whilst on it you look:<br>
              Denude yourselves of all depraved affection,<br>
              For it contains no badness, nor infection:<br>
              'Tis true that it brings forth to you no birth<br>
              Of any value, but in point of mirth;<br>
              Thinking therefore how sorrow might your mind<br>
              Consume, I could no apter subject find;<br>
              One inch of joy surmounts of grief a span;<br>
              Because to laugh is proper to the man.</p>

            <p>Chapter 1.I.</p>
            <p>Of the Genealogy and Antiquity of Gargantua.</p>
            <p>I must refer you to the great chronicle of Pantagruel for the knowledge of<br>
              that genealogy and antiquity of race by which Gargantua is come unto us.<br>
              In it you may understand more at large how the giants were born in this<br>
              world, and how from them by a direct line issued Gargantua, the father of<br>
              Pantagruel:  and do not take it ill, if for this time I pass by it,<br>
              although the subject be such, that the oftener it were remembered, the more<br>
              it would please your worshipful Seniorias; according to which you have the<br>
              authority of Plato in Philebo and Gorgias; and of Flaccus, who says that<br>
              there are some kinds of purposes (such as these are without doubt), which,<br>
              the frequentlier they be repeated, still prove the more delectable.</p>
            <p>Would to God everyone had as certain knowledge of his genealogy since the<br>
              time of the ark of Noah until this age.  I think many are at this day<br>
              emperors, kings, dukes, princes, and popes on the earth, whose extraction<br>
              is from some porters and pardon-pedlars; as, on the contrary, many are now<br>
              poor wandering beggars, wretched and miserable, who are descended of the<br>
              blood and lineage of great kings and emperors, occasioned, as I conceive<br>
              it, by the transport and revolution of kingdoms and empires, from the<br>
              Assyrians to the Medes, from the Medes to the Persians, from the Persians<br>
              to the Macedonians, from the Macedonians to the Romans, from the Romans to<br>
              the Greeks, from the Greeks to the French.</p>
            <p>And to give you some hint concerning myself, who speaks unto you, I cannot<br>
              think but I am come of the race of some rich king or prince in former<br>
              times; for never yet saw you any man that had a greater desire to be a<br>
              king, and to be rich, than I have, and that only that I may make good<br>
              cheer, do nothing, nor care for anything, and plentifully enrich my<br>
              friends, and all honest and learned men.  But herein do I comfort myself,<br>
              that in the other world I shall be so, yea and greater too than at this<br>
              present I dare wish.  As for you, with the same or a better conceit<br>
              consolate yourselves in your distresses, and drink fresh if you can come by<br>
              it.</p>
            <p>To return to our wethers, I say that by the sovereign gift of heaven, the<br>
              antiquity and genealogy of Gargantua hath been reserved for our use more<br>
              full and perfect than any other except that of the Messias, whereof I mean<br>
              not to speak; for it belongs not unto my purpose, and the devils, that is<br>
              to say, the false accusers and dissembled gospellers, will therein oppose<br>
              me.  This genealogy was found by John Andrew in a meadow, which he had near<br>
              the pole-arch, under the olive-tree, as you go to Narsay:  where, as he was<br>
              making cast up some ditches, the diggers with their mattocks struck against<br>
              a great brazen tomb, and unmeasurably long, for they could never find the<br>
              end thereof, by reason that it entered too far within the sluices of<br>
              Vienne.  Opening this tomb in a certain place thereof, sealed on the top<br>
              with the mark of a goblet, about which was written in Etrurian letters Hic<br>
              Bibitur, they found nine flagons set in such order as they use to rank<br>
              their kyles in Gascony, of which that which was placed in the middle had<br>
              under it a big, fat, great, grey, pretty, small, mouldy, little pamphlet,<br>
              smelling stronger, but no better than roses.  In that book the said<br>
              genealogy was found written all at length, in a chancery hand, not in<br>
              paper, not in parchment, nor in wax, but in the bark of an elm-tree, yet so<br>
              worn with the long tract of time, that hardly could three letters together<br>
              be there perfectly discerned.</p>
            <p>I (though unworthy) was sent for thither, and with much help of those<br>
              spectacles, whereby the art of reading dim writings, and letters that do<br>
              not clearly appear to the sight, is practised, as Aristotle teacheth it,<br>
              did translate the book as you may see in your Pantagruelizing, that is to<br>
              say, in drinking stiffly to your own heart's desire, and reading the<br>
              dreadful and horrific acts of Pantagruel.  At the end of the book there was<br>
              a little treatise entitled the Antidoted Fanfreluches, or a Galimatia of<br>
              extravagant conceits.  The rats and moths, or (that I may not lie) other<br>
              wicked beasts, had nibbled off the beginning:  the rest I have hereto<br>
              subjoined, for the reverence I bear to antiquity....</p>
            <p>Chapter 1.XI.</p>
            <p>Of the youthful age of Gargantua.</p>
            <p>Gargantua, from three years upwards unto five, was brought up and<br>
              instructed in all convenient discipline by the commandment of his father;<br>
              and spent that time like the other little children of the country, that is,<br>
              in drinking, eating, and sleeping:  in eating, sleeping, and drinking:  and<br>
              in sleeping, drinking, and eating.  Still he wallowed and rolled up and<br>
              down himself in the mire and dirt--he blurred and sullied his nose with<br>
              filth--he blotted and smutched his face with any kind of scurvy stuff--he<br>
              trod down his shoes in the heel--at the flies he did oftentimes yawn, and<br>
              ran very heartily after the butterflies, the empire whereof belonged to his<br>
              father.  He pissed in his shoes, shit in his shirt, and wiped his nose on<br>
              his sleeve--he did let his snot and snivel fall in his pottage, and<br>
              dabbled, paddled, and slobbered everywhere--he would drink in his slipper,<br>
              and ordinarily rub his belly against a pannier.  He sharpened his teeth<br>
              with a top, washed his hands with his broth, and combed his head with a<br>
              bowl.  He would sit down betwixt two stools, and his arse to the ground<br>
              --would cover himself with a wet sack, and drink in eating of his soup.  He<br>
              did eat his cake sometimes without bread, would bite in laughing, and laugh<br>
              in biting.  Oftentimes did he spit in the basin, and fart for fatness, piss<br>
              against the sun, and hide himself in the water for fear of rain.  He would<br>
              strike out of the cold iron, be often in the dumps, and frig and wriggle<br>
              it.  He would flay the fox, say the ape's paternoster, return to his sheep,<br>
              and turn the hogs to the hay.  He would beat the dogs before the lion, put<br>
              the plough before the oxen, and claw where it did not itch.  He would pump<br>
              one to draw somewhat out of him, by griping all would hold fast nothing,<br>
              and always eat his white bread first.  He shoed the geese, kept a<br>
              self-tickling to make himself laugh, and was very steadable in the kitchen:<br>
              made a mock at the gods, would cause sing Magnificat at matins, and found<br>
              it very convenient so to do.  He would eat cabbage, and shite beets,--knew<br>
              flies in a dish of milk, and would make them lose their feet.  He would<br>
              scrape paper, blur parchment, then run away as hard as he could.  He would<br>
              pull at the kid's leather, or vomit up his dinner, then reckon without his<br>
              host.  He would beat the bushes without catching the birds, thought the<br>
              moon was made of green cheese, and that bladders are lanterns.  Out of one<br>
              sack he would take two moultures or fees for grinding; would act the ass's<br>
              part to get some bran, and of his fist would make a mallet.  He took the<br>
              cranes at the first leap, and would have the mail-coats to be made link<br>
              after link.  He always looked a given horse in the mouth, leaped from the<br>
              cock to the ass, and put one ripe between two green.  By robbing Peter he<br>
              paid Paul, he kept the moon from the wolves, and hoped to catch larks if<br>
              ever the heavens should fall.  He did make of necessity virtue, of such<br>
              bread such pottage, and cared as little for the peeled as for the shaven.<br>
              Every morning he did cast up his gorge, and his father's little dogs eat<br>
              out of the dish with him, and he with them.  He would bite their ears, and<br>
              they would scratch his nose--he would blow in their arses, and they would<br>
              lick his chaps.</p>
            <p>But hearken, good fellows, the spigot ill betake you, and whirl round your<br>
              brains, if you do not give ear!  This little lecher was always groping his<br>
              nurses and governesses, upside down, arsiversy, topsyturvy, harri<br>
              bourriquet, with a Yacco haick, hyck gio! handling them very rudely in<br>
              jumbling and tumbling them to keep them going; for he had already begun to<br>
              exercise the tools, and put his codpiece in practice.  Which codpiece, or<br>
              braguette, his governesses did every day deck up and adorn with fair<br>
              nosegays, curious rubies, sweet flowers, and fine silken tufts, and very<br>
              pleasantly would pass their time in taking you know what between their<br>
              fingers, and dandling it, till it did revive and creep up to the bulk and<br>
              stiffness of a suppository, or street magdaleon, which is a hard rolled-up<br>
              salve spread upon leather.  Then did they burst out in laughing, when they<br>
              saw it lift up its ears, as if the sport had liked them.  One of them would<br>
              call it her little dille, her staff of love, her quillety, her faucetin,<br>
              her dandilolly.  Another, her peen, her jolly kyle, her bableret, her<br>
              membretoon, her quickset imp:  another again, her branch of coral, her<br>
              female adamant, her placket-racket, her Cyprian sceptre, her jewel for<br>
              ladies.  And some of the other women would give it these names,--my<br>
              bunguetee, my stopple too, my bush-rusher, my gallant wimble, my pretty<br>
              borer, my coney-burrow-ferret, my little piercer, my augretine, my dangling<br>
              hangers, down right to it, stiff and stout, in and to, my pusher, dresser,<br>
              pouting stick, my honey pipe, my pretty pillicock, linky pinky, futilletie,<br>
              my lusty andouille, and crimson chitterling, my little couille bredouille,<br>
              my pretty rogue, and so forth.  It belongs to me, said one.  It is mine,<br>
              said the other.  What, quoth a third, shall I have no share in it?  By my<br>
              faith, I will cut it then.  Ha, to cut it, said the other, would hurt him.<br>
              Madam, do you cut little children's things?  Were his cut off, he would be<br>
              then Monsieur sans queue, the curtailed master.  And that he might play and<br>
              sport himself after the manner of the other little children of the country,<br>
              they made him a fair weather whirl-jack of the wings of the windmill of<br>
              Myrebalais.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Chapter 1.XIII.</p>
            <p>How Gargantua's wonderful understanding became known to his father<br>
              Grangousier, by the invention of a torchecul or wipebreech.</p>
            <p>About the end of the fifth year, Grangousier returning from the conquest of<br>
              the Canarians, went by the way to see his son Gargantua.  There was he<br>
              filled with joy, as such a father might be at the sight of such a child of<br>
              his:  and whilst he kissed and embraced him, he asked many childish<br>
              questions of him about divers matters, and drank very freely with him and<br>
              with his governesses, of whom in great earnest he asked, amongst other<br>
              things, whether they had been careful to keep him clean and sweet.  To this<br>
              Gargantua answered, that he had taken such a course for that himself, that<br>
              in all the country there was not to be found a cleanlier boy than he.  How<br>
              is that? said Grangousier.  I have, answered Gargantua, by a long and<br>
              curious experience, found out a means to wipe my bum, the most lordly, the<br>
              most excellent, and the most convenient that ever was seen.  What is that?<br>
              said Grangousier, how is it?  I will tell you by-and-by, said Gargantua.<br>
              Once I did wipe me with a gentle-woman's velvet mask, and found it to be<br>
              good; for the softness of the silk was very voluptuous and pleasant to my<br>
              fundament.  Another time with one of their hoods, and in like manner that<br>
              was comfortable.  At another time with a lady's neckerchief, and after that<br>
              I wiped me with some ear-pieces of hers made of crimson satin, but there<br>
              was such a number of golden spangles in them (turdy round things, a pox<br>
              take them) that they fetched away all the skin of my tail with a vengeance.<br>
              Now I wish St. Antony's fire burn the bum-gut of the goldsmith that made<br>
              them, and of her that wore them!  This hurt I cured by wiping myself with a<br>
              page's cap, garnished with a feather after the Switzers' fashion.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, in dunging behind a bush, I found a March-cat, and with it I<br>
              wiped my breech, but her claws were so sharp that they scratched and<br>
              exulcerated all my perinee.  Of this I recovered the next morning<br>
              thereafter, by wiping myself with my mother's gloves, of a most excellent<br>
              perfume and scent of the Arabian Benin.  After that I wiped me with sage,<br>
              with fennel, with anet, with marjoram, with roses, with gourd-leaves, with<br>
              beets, with colewort, with leaves of the vine-tree, with mallows,<br>
              wool-blade, which is a tail-scarlet, with lettuce, and with spinach leaves.<br>
              All this did very great good to my leg.  Then with mercury, with parsley,<br>
              with nettles, with comfrey, but that gave me the bloody flux of Lombardy,<br>
              which I healed by wiping me with my braguette.  Then I wiped my tail in the<br>
              sheets, in the coverlet, in the curtains, with a cushion, with arras<br>
              hangings, with a green carpet, with a table-cloth, with a napkin, with a<br>
              handkerchief, with a combing-cloth; in all which I found more pleasure than<br>
              do the mangy dogs when you rub them.  Yea, but, said Grangousier, which<br>
              torchecul did you find to be the best?  I was coming to it, said Gargantua,<br>
              and by-and-by shall you hear the tu autem, and know the whole mystery and<br>
              knot of the matter.  I wiped myself with hay, with straw, with<br>
              thatch-rushes, with flax, with wool, with paper, but,</p>
            <p> Who his foul tail with paper wipes,<br>
              Shall at his ballocks leave some chips.</p>
            <p>What, said Grangousier, my little rogue, hast thou been at the pot, that<br>
              thou dost rhyme already?  Yes, yes, my lord the king, answered Gargantua, I<br>
              can rhyme gallantly, and rhyme till I become hoarse with rheum.  Hark, what<br>
              our privy says to the skiters:<br>
            </p>
            <p>Shittard,<br>
              Squirtard,<br>
              Crackard,<br>
              Turdous,<br>
              Thy bung<br>
              Hath flung<br>
              Some dung<br>
              On us:<br>
              Filthard,<br>
              Cackard,<br>
              Stinkard,<br>
              St. Antony's fire seize on thy toane (bone?),<br>
              If thy<br>
              Dirty<br>
              Dounby<br>
              Thou do not wipe, ere thou be gone.</p>
            <p>Will you have any more of it?  Yes, yes, answered Grangousier.  Then, said<br>
              Gargantua,</p>
            <p>A Roundelay.</p>
            <p>In shitting yes'day I did know<br>
              The sess I to my arse did owe:<br>
              The smell was such came from that slunk,<br>
              That I was with it all bestunk:<br>
              O had but then some brave Signor<br>
              Brought her to me I waited for,<br>
              In shitting!</p>
            <p>I would have cleft her watergap,<br>
              And join'd it close to my flipflap,<br>
              Whilst she had with her fingers guarded<br>
              My foul nockandrow, all bemerded<br>
              In shitting.</p>
            <p>Now say that I can do nothing!  By the Merdi, they are not of my making,<br>
              but I heard them of this good old grandam, that you see here, and ever<br>
              since have retained them in the budget of my memory.</p>
            <p>Let us return to our purpose, said Grangousier.  What, said Gargantua, to<br>
              skite?  No, said Grangousier, but to wipe our tail.  But, said Gargantua,<br>
              will not you be content to pay a puncheon of Breton wine, if I do not blank<br>
              and gravel you in this matter, and put you to a non-plus?  Yes, truly, said<br>
              Grangousier.</p>
            <p>There is no need of wiping one's tail, said Gargantua, but when it is foul;<br>
              foul it cannot be, unless one have been a-skiting; skite then we must<br>
              before we wipe our tails.  O my pretty little waggish boy, said<br>
              Grangousier, what an excellent wit thou hast?  I will make thee very<br>
              shortly proceed doctor in the jovial quirks of gay learning, and that, by<br>
              G--, for thou hast more wit than age.  Now, I prithee, go on in this<br>
              torcheculative, or wipe-bummatory discourse, and by my beard I swear, for<br>
              one puncheon, thou shalt have threescore pipes, I mean of the good Breton<br>
              wine, not that which grows in Britain, but in the good country of Verron.<br>
              Afterwards I wiped my bum, said Gargantua, with a kerchief, with a pillow,<br>
              with a pantoufle, with a pouch, with a pannier, but that was a wicked and<br>
              unpleasant torchecul; then with a hat.  Of hats, note that some are shorn,<br>
              and others shaggy, some velveted, others covered with taffeties, and others<br>
              with satin.  The best of all these is the shaggy hat, for it makes a very<br>
              neat abstersion of the fecal matter.</p>
            <p>Afterwards I wiped my tail with a hen, with a cock, with a pullet, with a<br>
              calf's skin, with a hare, with a pigeon, with a cormorant, with an<br>
              attorney's bag, with a montero, with a coif, with a falconer's lure.  But,<br>
              to conclude, I say and maintain, that of all torcheculs, arsewisps,<br>
              bumfodders, tail-napkins, bunghole cleansers, and wipe-breeches, there is<br>
              none in the world comparable to the neck of a goose, that is well downed,<br>
              if you hold her head betwixt your legs.  And believe me therein upon mine<br>
              honour, for you will thereby feel in your nockhole a most wonderful<br>
              pleasure, both in regard of the softness of the said down and of the<br>
              temporate heat of the goose, which is easily communicated to the bum-gut<br>
              and the rest of the inwards, in so far as to come even to the regions of<br>
              the heart and brains.  And think not that the felicity of the heroes and<br>
              demigods in the Elysian fields consisteth either in their asphodel,<br>
              ambrosia, or nectar, as our old women here used to say; but in this,<br>
              according to my judgment, that they wipe their tails with the neck of a<br>
              goose, holding her head betwixt their legs, and such is the opinion of<br>
              Master John of Scotland, alias Scotus.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Chapter 1.LII.</p>
            <p>How Gargantua caused to be built for the Monk the Abbey of Theleme.</p>
            <p>There was left only the monk to provide for, whom Gargantua would have made<br>
              Abbot of Seville, but he refused it.  He would have given him the Abbey of<br>
              Bourgueil, or of Sanct Florent, which was better, or both, if it pleased<br>
              him; but the monk gave him a very peremptory answer, that he would never<br>
              take upon him the charge nor government of monks.  For how shall I be able,<br>
              said he, to rule over others, that have not full power and command of<br>
              myself?  If you think I have done you, or may hereafter do any acceptable<br>
              service, give me leave to found an abbey after my own mind and fancy.  The<br>
              motion pleased Gargantua very well, who thereupon offered him all the<br>
              country of Theleme by the river of Loire till within two leagues of the<br>
              great forest of Port-Huaulx.  The monk then requested Gargantua to<br>
              institute his religious order contrary to all others.  First, then, said<br>
              Gargantua, you must not build a wall about your convent, for all other<br>
              abbeys are strongly walled and mured about.  See, said the monk, and not<br>
              without cause (seeing wall and mur signify but one and the same thing);<br>
              where there is mur before and mur behind, there is store of murmur, envy,<br>
              and mutual conspiracy.  Moreover, seeing there are certain convents in the<br>
              world whereof the custom is, if any woman come in, I mean chaste and honest<br>
              women, they immediately sweep the ground which they have trod upon;<br>
              therefore was it ordained, that if any man or woman entered into religious<br>
              orders should by chance come within this new abbey, all the rooms should be<br>
              thoroughly washed and cleansed through which they had passed.  And because<br>
              in all other monasteries and nunneries all is compassed, limited, and<br>
              regulated by hours, it was decreed that in this new structure there should<br>
              be neither clock nor dial, but that according to the opportunities and<br>
              incident occasions all their hours should be disposed of; for, said<br>
              Gargantua, the greatest loss of time that I know is to count the hours.<br>
              What good comes of it?  Nor can there be any greater dotage in the world<br>
              than for one to guide and direct his courses by the sound of a bell, and<br>
              not by his own judgment and discretion.</p>
            <p>Item, Because at that time they put no women into nunneries but such as<br>
              were either purblind, blinkards, lame, crooked, ill-favoured, misshapen,<br>
              fools, senseless, spoiled, or corrupt; nor encloistered any men but those<br>
              that were either sickly, subject to defluxions, ill-bred louts, simple<br>
              sots, or peevish trouble-houses.  But to the purpose, said the monk.  A<br>
              woman that is neither fair nor good, to what use serves she?  To make a nun<br>
              of, said Gargantua.  Yea, said the monk, and to make shirts and smocks.<br>
              Therefore was it ordained that into this religious order should be admitted<br>
              no women that were not fair, well-featured, and of a sweet disposition; nor<br>
              men that were not comely, personable, and well conditioned.</p>
            <p>Item, Because in the convents of women men come not but underhand, privily,<br>
              and by stealth, it was therefore enacted that in this house there shall be<br>
              no women in case there be not men, nor men in case there be not women.</p>
            <p>Item, Because both men and women that are received into religious orders<br>
              after the expiring of their noviciate or probation year were constrained<br>
              and forced perpetually to stay there all the days of their life, it was<br>
              therefore ordered that all whatever, men or women, admitted within this<br>
              abbey, should have full leave to depart with peace and contentment<br>
              whensoever it should seem good to them so to do.</p>
            <p>Item, for that the religious men and women did ordinarily make three vows,<br>
              to wit, those of chastity, poverty, and obedience, it was therefore<br>
              constituted and appointed that in this convent they might be honourably<br>
              married, that they might be rich, and live at liberty.  In regard of the<br>
              legitimate time of the persons to be initiated, and years under and above<br>
              which they were not capable of reception, the women were to be admitted<br>
              from ten till fifteen, and the men from twelve till eighteen.</p>

            <p>Chapter 1.LVII.</p>
            <p>How the Thelemites were governed, and of their manner of living.</p>
            <p>All their life was spent not in laws, statutes, or rules, but according to<br>
              their own free will and pleasure.  They rose out of their beds when they<br>
              thought good; they did eat, drink, labour, sleep, when they had a mind to<br>
              it and were disposed for it.  None did awake them, none did offer to<br>
              constrain them to eat, drink, nor to do any other thing; for so had<br>
              Gargantua established it.  In all their rule and strictest tie of their<br>
              order there was but this one clause to be observed,</p>
            <p>Do What Thou Wilt;</p>
            <p>because men that are free, well-born, well-bred, and conversant in honest<br>
              companies, have naturally an instinct and spur that prompteth them unto<br>
              virtuous actions, and withdraws them from vice, which is called honour.<br>
              Those same men, when by base subjection and constraint they are brought<br>
              under and kept down, turn aside from that noble disposition by which they<br>
              formerly were inclined to virtue, to shake off and break that bond of<br>
              servitude wherein they are so tyrannously enslaved; for it is agreeable<br>
              with the nature of man to long after things forbidden and to desire what is<br>
              denied us.</p>
            <p>By this liberty they entered into a very laudable emulation to do all of<br>
              them what they saw did please one.  If any of the gallants or ladies should<br>
              say, Let us drink, they would all drink.  If any one of them said, Let us<br>
              play, they all played.  If one said, Let us go a-walking into the fields<br>
              they went all.  If it were to go a-hawking or a-hunting, the ladies mounted<br>
              upon dainty well-paced nags, seated in a stately palfrey saddle, carried on<br>
              their lovely fists, miniardly begloved every one of them, either a<br>
              sparrowhawk or a laneret or a marlin, and the young gallants carried the<br>
              other kinds of hawks.  So nobly were they taught, that there was neither he<br>
              nor she amongst them but could read, write, sing, play upon several musical<br>
              instruments, speak five or six several languages, and compose in them all<br>
              very quaintly, both in verse and prose.  Never were seen so valiant<br>
              knights, so noble and worthy, so dexterous and skilful both on foot and<br>
              a-horse-back, more brisk and lively, more nimble and quick, or better<br>
              handling all manner of weapons than were there.  Never were seen ladies so<br>
              proper and handsome, so miniard and dainty, less froward, or more ready<br>
              with their hand and with their needle in every honest and free action<br>
              belonging to that sex, than were there.  For this reason, when the time<br>
              came that any man of the said abbey, either at the request of his parents,<br>
              or for some other cause, had a mind to go out of it, he carried along with<br>
              him one of the ladies, namely, her whom he had before that chosen for his<br>
              mistress, and (they) were married together.  And if they had formerly in<br>
              Theleme lived in good devotion and amity, they did continue therein and<br>
              increase it to a greater height in their state of matrimony; and did<br>
              entertain that mutual love till the very last day of their life, in no less<br>
              vigour and fervency than at the very day of their wedding.  Here must not I<br>
              forget to set down unto you a riddle which was found under the ground as<br>
              they were laying the foundation of the abbey, engraven in a copper plate,<br>
              and it was thus as followeth.</p>

            <p>The Author's Prologue.</p>
            <p>Most illustrious and thrice valorous champions, gentlemen and others, who<br>
              willingly apply your minds to the entertainment of pretty conceits and<br>
              honest harmless knacks of wit; you have not long ago seen, read, and<br>
              understood the great and inestimable Chronicle of the huge and mighty giant<br>
              Gargantua, and, like upright faithfullists, have firmly believed all to be<br>
              true that is contained in them, and have very often passed your time with<br>
              them amongst honourable ladies and gentlewomen, telling them fair long<br>
              stories, when you were out of all other talk, for which you are worthy of<br>
              great praise and sempiternal memory.  And I do heartily wish that every man<br>
              would lay aside his own business, meddle no more with his profession nor<br>
              trade, and throw all affairs concerning himself behind his back, to attend<br>
              this wholly, without distracting or troubling his mind with anything else,<br>
              until he have learned them without book; that if by chance the art of<br>
              printing should cease, or in case that in time to come all books should<br>
              perish, every man might truly teach them unto his children, and deliver<br>
              them over to his successors and survivors from hand to hand as a religious<br>
              cabal; for there is in it more profit than a rabble of great pocky<br>
              loggerheads are able to discern, who surely understand far less in these<br>
              little merriments than the fool Raclet did in the Institutions of<br>
              Justinian.</p>
            <p>I have known great and mighty lords, and of those not a few, who, going<br>
              a-deer-hunting, or a-hawking after wild ducks, when the chase had not<br>
              encountered with the blinks that were cast in her way to retard her course,<br>
              or that the hawk did but plain and smoothly fly without moving her wings,<br>
              perceiving the prey by force of flight to have gained bounds of her, have<br>
              been much chafed and vexed, as you understand well enough; but the comfort<br>
              unto which they had refuge, and that they might not take cold, was to<br>
              relate the inestimable deeds of the said Gargantua.  There are others in<br>
              the world--these are no flimflam stories, nor tales of a tub--who, being<br>
              much troubled with the toothache, after they had spent their goods upon<br>
              physicians without receiving at all any ease of their pain, have found no<br>
              more ready remedy than to put the said Chronicles betwixt two pieces of<br>
              linen cloth made somewhat hot, and so apply them to the place that<br>
              smarteth, sinapizing them with a little powder of projection, otherwise<br>
              called doribus.</p>
            <p>But what shall I say of those poor men that are plagued with the pox and<br>
              the gout?  O how often have we seen them, even immediately after they were<br>
              anointed and thoroughly greased, till their faces did glister like the<br>
              keyhole of a powdering tub, their teeth dance like the jacks of a pair of<br>
              little organs or virginals when they are played upon, and that they foamed<br>
              from their very throats like a boar which the mongrel mastiff-hounds have<br>
              driven in and overthrown amongst the toils,--what did they then?  All their<br>
              consolation was to have some page of the said jolly book read unto them.<br>
              And we have seen those who have given themselves to a hundred puncheons of<br>
              old devils, in case that they did not feel a manifest ease and assuagement<br>
              of pain at the hearing of the said book read, even when they were kept in a<br>
              purgatory of torment; no more nor less than women in travail use to find<br>
              their sorrow abated when the life of St. Margaret is read unto them.  Is<br>
              this nothing?  Find me a book in any language, in any faculty or science<br>
              whatsoever, that hath such virtues, properties, and prerogatives, and I<br>
              will be content to pay you a quart of tripes.  No, my masters, no; it is<br>
              peerless, incomparable, and not to be matched; and this am I resolved for<br>
              ever to maintain even unto the fire exclusive.  And those that will<br>
              pertinaciously hold the contrary opinion, let them be accounted abusers,<br>
              predestinators, impostors, and seducers of the people.  It is very true<br>
              that there are found in some gallant and stately books, worthy of high<br>
              estimation, certain occult and hid properties; in the number of which are<br>
              reckoned Whippot, Orlando Furioso, Robert the Devil, Fierabras, William<br>
              without Fear, Huon of Bordeaux, Monteville, and Matabrune: but they are not<br>
              comparable to that which we speak of, and the world hath well known by<br>
              infallible experience the great emolument and utility which it hath<br>
              received by this Gargantuine Chronicle, for the printers have sold more of<br>
              them in two months' time than there will be bought of Bibles in nine years.</p>
            <p>I therefore, your humble slave, being very willing to increase your solace<br>
              and recreation yet a little more, do offer you for a present another book<br>
              of the same stamp, only that it is a little more reasonable and worthy of<br>
              credit than the other was.  For think not, unless you wilfully will err<br>
              against your knowledge, that I speak of it as the Jews do of the Law.  I<br>
              was not born under such a planet, neither did it ever befall me to lie, or<br>
              affirm a thing for true that was not.  I speak of it like a lusty frolic<br>
              onocrotary (Onocratal is a bird not much unlike a swan, which sings like an<br>
              ass's braying.), I should say crotenotary (Crotenotaire or notaire crotte,<br>
              croquenotaire or notaire croque are but allusions in derision of<br>
              protonotaire, which signifieth a pregnotary.) of the martyrized lovers, and<br>
              croquenotary of love.  Quod vidimus, testamur.  It is of the horrible and<br>
              dreadful feats and prowesses of Pantagruel, whose menial servant I have<br>
              been ever since I was a page, till this hour that by his leave I am<br>
              permitted to visit my cow-country, and to know if any of my kindred there<br>
              be alive.</p>
            <p>And therefore, to make an end of this Prologue, even as I give myself to a<br>
              hundred panniersful of fair devils, body and soul, tripes and guts, in case<br>
              that I lie so much as one single word in this whole history; after the like<br>
              manner, St. Anthony's fire burn you, Mahoom's disease whirl you, the<br>
              squinance with a stitch in your side and the wolf in your stomach truss<br>
              you, the bloody flux seize upon you, the cursed sharp inflammations of<br>
              wild-fire, as slender and thin as cow's hair strengthened with quicksilver,<br>
              enter into your fundament, and, like those of Sodom and Gomorrah, may you<br>
              fall into sulphur, fire, and bottomless pits, in case you do not firmly<br>
              believe all that I shall relate unto you in this present Chronicle.</p>
