        <p align="left"> Socrates - ADEIMANTUS</p>
        <p align="left"> Adeimantus thought that the enquiry would be of great service to us.<br>
          Then, I said, my dear friend, the task must not be given up, even if somewhat long.</p>
        <p align="left"> Certainly not.<br>
          Come then, and let us pass a leisure hour in story-telling, and our story shall be the education of our heroes.</p>
        <p align="left"> By all means.<br>
          And what shall be their education? Can we find a better than the traditional sort? --and this has two divisions, gymnastic for the body, and music for the soul.</p>
        <p align="left"> True.<br>
          Shall we begin education with music, and go on to gymnastic afterwards?</p>
        <p align="left"> By all means.<br>
          And when you speak of music, do you include literature or not?<br>
          I do.<br>
          And literature may be either true or false?<br>
          Yes.<br>
          And the young should be trained in both kinds, and we begin with the false?</p>
        <p align="left"> I do not understand your meaning, he said.<br>
          You know, I said, that we begin by telling children stories which, though not wholly destitute of truth, are in the main fictitious; and these stories are told them when they are not of an age to learn gymnastics.</p>
        <p align="left"> Very true.<br>
          That was my meaning when I said that we must teach music before gymnastics.</p>
        <p align="left"> Quite right, he said.<br>
          You know also that the beginning is the most important part of any work, especially in the case of a young and tender thing; for that is the time at which the character is being formed and the desired impression is more readily taken.</p>
        <p align="left"> Quite true.<br>
          And shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales which may be devised by casual persons, and to receive into their minds ideas for the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish them to have when they are grown up?</p>
        <p align="left"> We cannot.<br>
          Then the first thing will be to establish a censorship of the writers of fiction, and let the censors receive any tale of fiction which is good, and reject the bad; and we will desire mothers and nurses to tell their children the authorised ones only. Let them fashion the mind with such tales, even more fondly than they mould the body with their hands; but most of those which are now in use must be discarded.</p>
        <p align="left"> Of what tales are you speaking? he said.<br>
          You may find a model of the lesser in the greater, I said; for they are necessarily of the same type, and there is the same spirit in both of them.</p>
        <p align="left"> Very likely, he replied; but I do not as yet know what you would term the greater.</p>
        <p align="left"> Those, I said, which are narrated by Homer and Hesiod, and the rest of the poets, who have ever been the great story-tellers of mankind.</p>
        <p align="left"> But which stories do you mean, he said; and what fault do you find with them?</p>
        <p align="left"> A fault which is most serious, I said; the fault of telling a lie, and, what is more, a bad lie.</p>
        <p align="left"> But when is this fault committed?<br>
          Whenever an erroneous representation is made of the nature of gods and heroes, --as when a painter paints a portrait not having the shadow of a likeness to the original.</p>
        <p align="left"> Yes, he said, that sort of thing is certainly very blamable; but what are the stories which you mean?</p>
        <p align="left"> First of all, I said, there was that greatest of all lies, in high places, which the poet told about Uranus, and which was a bad lie too, --I mean what Hesiod says that Uranus did, and how Cronus retaliated on him. The doings of Cronus, and the sufferings which in turn his son inflicted upon him, even if they were true, ought certainly not to be lightly told to young and thoughtless persons; if possible, they had better be buried in silence. But if there is an absolute necessity for their mention, a chosen few might hear them in a mystery, and they should sacrifice not a common [Eleusinian] pig, but some huge and unprocurable victim; and then the number of the hearers will be very few indeed.</p>
        <p align="left"> Why, yes, said he, those stories are extremely objectionable.<br>
          Yes, Adeimantus, they are stories not to be repeated in our State; the young man should not be told that in committing the worst of crimes he is far from doing anything outrageous; and that even if he chastises his father when does wrong, in whatever manner, he will only be following the example of the first and greatest among the gods.</p>
        <p align="left"> I entirely agree with you, he said; in my opinion those stories are quite unfit to be repeated.</p>
        <p align="left"> Neither, if we mean our future guardians to regard the habit of quarrelling among themselves as of all things the basest, should any word be said to them of the wars in heaven, and of the plots and fightings of the gods against one another, for they are not true. No, we shall never mention the battles of the giants, or let them be embroidered on garments; and we shall be silent about the innumerable other quarrels of gods and heroes with their friends and relatives. If they would only believe us we would tell them that quarrelling is unholy, and that never up to this time has there been any, quarrel between citizens; this is what old men and old women should begin by telling children; and when they grow up, the poets also should be told to compose for them in a similar spirit. But the narrative of Hephaestus binding Here his mother, or how on another occasion Zeus sent him flying for taking her part when she was being beaten, and all the battles of the gods in Homer --these tales must not be admitted into our State, whether they are supposed to have an allegorical meaning or not. For a young person cannot judge what is allegorical and what is literal; anything that he receives into his mind at that age is likely to become indelible and unalterable; and therefore it is most important that the tales which the young first hear should be models of virtuous thoughts.</p>
        <p align="left"> There you are right, he replied; but if any one asks where are such models to be found and of what tales are you speaking --how shall we answer him?</p>
        <p align="left"> I said to him, You and I, Adeimantus, at this moment are not poets, but founders of a State: now the founders of a State ought to know the general forms in which poets should cast their tales, and the limits which must be observed by them, but to make the tales is not their business.</p>
        <p align="left"> Very true, he said; but what are these forms of theology which you mean?</p>
        <p align="left"> Something of this kind, I replied: --God is always to be represented as he truly is, whatever be the sort of poetry, epic, lyric or tragic, in which the representation is given.</p>
        <p align="left"> Right.<br>
          And is he not truly good? and must he not be represented as such?<br>
          Certainly.<br>
          And no good thing is hurtful?<br>
          No, indeed.<br>
          And that which is not hurtful hurts not?<br>
          Certainly not.<br>
          And that which hurts not does no evil?<br>
          No.<br>
          And can that which does no evil be a cause of evil?<br>
          Impossible.<br>
          And the good is advantageous?<br>
          Yes.<br>
          And therefore the cause of well-being?<br>
          Yes.<br>
          It follows therefore that the good is not the cause of all things, but of the good only?</p>
        <p align="left"> Assuredly.<br>
          Then God, if he be good, is not the author of all things, as the many assert, but he is the cause of a few things only, and not of most things that occur to men. For few are the goods of human life, and many are the evils, and the good is to be attributed to God alone; of the evils the causes are to be sought elsewhere, and not in him.</p>
        <p align="left"> That appears to me to be most true, he said.<br>
          Then we must not listen to Homer or to any other poet who is guilty of the folly of saying that two casks Lie at the threshold of Zeus, full of lots, one of good, the other of evil lots, and that he to whom Zeus gives a mixture of the two Sometimes meets with evil fortune, at other times with good; but that he to whom is given the cup of unmingled ill,</p>
        <p align="left"> Him wild hunger drives o'er the beauteous earth. And again</p>
        <p align="left"> Zeus, who is the dispenser of good and evil to us. And if any one asserts that the violation of oaths and treaties, which was really the work of Pandarus, was brought about by Athene and Zeus, or that the strife and contention of the gods was instigated by Themis and Zeus, he shall not have our approval; neither will we allow our young men to hear the words of Aeschylus, that God plants guilt among men when he desires utterly to destroy a house. And if a poet writes of the sufferings of Niobe --the subject of the tragedy in which these iambic verses occur --or of the house of Pelops, or of the Trojan war or on any similar theme, either we must not permit him to say that these are the works of God, or if they are of God, he must devise some explanation of them such as we are seeking; he must say that God did what was just and right, and they were the better for being punished; but that those who are punished are miserable, and that God is the author of their misery --the poet is not to be permitted to say; though he may say that the wicked are miserable because they require to be punished, and are benefited by receiving punishment from God; but that God being good is the author of evil to any one is to be strenuously denied, and not to be said or sung or heard in verse or prose by any one whether old or young in any well-ordered commonwealth. Such a fiction is suicidal, ruinous, impious.</p>
        <p align="left"> I agree with you, he replied, and am ready to give my assent to the law.</p>
        <p align="left"> Let this then be one of our rules and principles concerning the gods, to which our poets and reciters will be expected to conform --that God is not the author of all things, but of good only.</p>
        <p align="left"> That will do, he said.<br>
          And what do you think of a second principle? Shall I ask you whether God is a magician, and of a nature to appear insidiously now in one shape, and now in another --sometimes himself changing and passing into many forms, sometimes deceiving us with the semblance of such transformations; or is he one and the same immutably fixed in his own proper image?</p>
        <p align="left"> I cannot answer you, he said, without more thought.<br>
          Well, I said; but if we suppose a change in anything, that change must be effected either by the thing itself, or by some other thing?</p>
        <p align="left"> Most certainly.<br>
          And things which are at their best are also least liable to be altered or discomposed; for example, when healthiest and strongest, the human frame is least liable to be affected by meats and drinks, and the plant which is in the fullest vigour also suffers least from winds or the heat of the sun or any similar causes.</p>
        <p align="left"> Of course.<br>
          And will not the bravest and wisest soul be least confused or deranged by any external influence?</p>
        <p align="left"> True.<br>
          And the same principle, as I should suppose, applies to all composite things --furniture, houses, garments; when good and well made, they are least altered by time and circumstances.</p>
        <p align="left"> Very true.<br>
          Then everything which is good, whether made by art or nature, or both, is least liable to suffer change from without?</p>
        <p align="left"> True.<br>
          But surely God and the things of God are in every way perfect?<br>
          Of course they are.<br>
          Then he can hardly be compelled by external influence to take many shapes?</p>
        <p align="left"> He cannot.<br>
          But may he not change and transform himself?<br>
          Clearly, he said, that must be the case if he is changed at all.<br>
          And will he then change himself for the better and fairer, or for the worse and more unsightly?</p>
        <p align="left"> If he change at all he can only change for the worse, for we cannot suppose him to be deficient either in virtue or beauty.</p>
        <p align="left"> Very true, Adeimantus; but then, would any one, whether God or man, desire to make himself worse?</p>
        <p align="left"> Impossible.<br>
          Then it is impossible that God should ever be willing to change; being, as is supposed, the fairest and best that is conceivable, every god remains absolutely and for ever in his own form.</p>
        <p align="left"> That necessarily follows, he said, in my judgment.<br>
          Then, I said, my dear friend, let none of the poets tell us that</p>
        <p align="left"> The gods, taking the disguise of strangers from other lands, walk up and down cities in all sorts of forms; and let no one slander Proteus and Thetis, neither let any one, either in tragedy or in any other kind of poetry, introduce Here disguised in the likeness of a priestess asking an alms</p>
        <p align="left"> For the life-giving daughters of Inachus the river of Argos; --let us have no more lies of that sort. Neither must we have mothers under the influence of the poets scaring their children with a bad version of these myths --telling how certain gods, as they say, 'Go about by night in the likeness of so many strangers and in divers forms'; but let them take heed lest they make cowards of their children, and at the same time speak blasphemy against the gods.</p>
        <p align="left"> Heaven forbid, he said.<br>
          But although the gods are themselves unchangeable, still by witchcraft and deception they may make us think that they appear in various forms?</p>
        <p align="left"> Perhaps, he replied.<br>
          Well, but can you imagine that God will be willing to lie, whether in word or deed, or to put forth a phantom of himself?</p>
        <p align="left"> I cannot say, he replied.<br>
          Do you not know, I said, that the true lie, if such an expression may be allowed, is hated of gods and men?</p>
        <p align="left"> What do you mean? he said.<br>
          I mean that no one is willingly deceived in that which is the truest and highest part of himself, or about the truest and highest matters; there, above all, he is most afraid of a lie having possession of him.</p>
        <p align="left"> Still, he said, I do not comprehend you.<br>
          The reason is, I replied, that you attribute some profound meaning to my words; but I am only saying that deception, or being deceived or uninformed about the highest realities in the highest part of themselves, which is the soul, and in that part of them to have and to hold the lie, is what mankind least like; --that, I say, is what they utterly detest.</p>
        <p align="left"> There is nothing more hateful to them.<br>
          And, as I was just now remarking, this ignorance in the soul of him who is deceived may be called the true lie; for the lie in words is only a kind of imitation and shadowy image of a previous affection of the soul, not pure unadulterated falsehood. Am I not right?</p>
        <p align="left"> Perfectly right.<br>
          The true lie is hated not only by the gods, but also by men?<br>
          Yes.<br>
          Whereas the lie in words is in certain cases useful and not hateful; in dealing with enemies --that would be an instance; or again, when those whom we call our friends in a fit of madness or illusion are going to do some harm, then it is useful and is a sort of medicine or preventive; also in the tales of mythology, of which we were just now speaking --because we do not know the truth about ancient times, we make falsehood as much like truth as we can, and so turn it to account.</p>
        <p align="left"> Very true, he said.<br>
          But can any of these reasons apply to God? Can we suppose that he is ignorant of antiquity, and therefore has recourse to invention?</p>
        <p align="left"> That would be ridiculous, he said.<br>
          Then the lying poet has no place in our idea of God?<br>
          I should say not.<br>
          Or perhaps he may tell a lie because he is afraid of enemies?<br>
          That is inconceivable.<br>
          But he may have friends who are senseless or mad?<br>
          But no mad or senseless person can be a friend of God.<br>
          Then no motive can be imagined why God should lie?<br>
          None whatever.<br>
          Then the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of falsehood?<br>
          Yes.<br>
          Then is God perfectly simple and true both in word and deed; he changes not; he deceives not, either by sign or word, by dream or waking vision.</p>
        <p align="left"> Your thoughts, he said, are the reflection of my own.<br>
          You agree with me then, I said, that this is the second type or form in which we should write and speak about divine things. The gods are not magicians who transform themselves, neither do they deceive mankind in any way.</p>
        <p align="left"> I grant that.<br>
          Then, although we are admirers of Homer, we do not admire the lying dream which Zeus sends to Agamemnon; neither will we praise the verses of Aeschylus in which Thetis says that Apollo at her nuptials</p>
        <p align="left"> Was celebrating in song her fair progeny whose days were to he long, and to know no sickness. And when he had spoken of my lot as in all things blessed of heaven he raised a note of triumph and cheered my soul. And I thought that the word of Phoebus being divine and full of prophecy, would not fail. And now he himself who uttered the strain, he who was present at the banquet, and who said this --he it is who has slain my son.</p>
        <p align="left"> These are the kind of sentiments about the gods which will arouse our anger; and he who utters them shall be refused a chorus; neither shall we allow teachers to make use of them in the instruction of the young, meaning, as we do, that our guardians, as far as men can be, should be true worshippers of the gods and like them.</p>
        <p align="left"> I entirely agree, be said, in these principles, and promise to make them my laws.</p>
        <p align="left">Such then, I said, are our principles of theology --some tales are to be told, and others are not to be told to our disciples from their youth upwards, if we mean them to honour the gods and their parents, and to value friendship with one another.</p>
        <p align="left">Yes; and I think that our principles are right, he said.<br>
          But if they are to be courageous, must they not learn other lessons besides these, and lessons of such a kind as will take away the fear of death? Can any man be courageous who has the fear of death in him?</p>
        <p align="left">Certainly not, he said.<br>
          And can he be fearless of death, or will he choose death in battle rather than defeat and slavery, who believes the world below to be real and terrible?</p>
        <p align="left">Impossible.<br>
          Then we must assume a control over the narrators of this class of tales as well as over the others, and beg them not simply to but rather to commend the world below, intimating to them that their descriptions are untrue, and will do harm to our future warriors.</p>
        <p align="left">That will be our duty, he said.<br>
          Then, I said, we shall have to obliterate many obnoxious passages, beginning with the verses,</p>
        <p align="left">I would rather he a serf on the land of a poor and portionless man than rule over all the dead who have come to nought. We must also expunge the verse, which tells us how Pluto feared,</p>
        <p align="left">Lest the mansions grim and squalid which the gods abhor should he seen both of mortals and immortals. And again:</p>
        <p align="left">O heavens! verily in the house of Hades there is soul and ghostly form but no mind at all! Again of Tiresias: --</p>
        <p align="left">[To him even after death did Persephone grant mind,] that he alone should be wise; but the other souls are flitting shades. Again: --</p>
        <p align="left">The soul flying from the limbs had gone to Hades, lamentng her fate, leaving manhood and youth. Again: --</p>
        <p align="left">And the soul, with shrilling cry, passed like smoke beneath the earth. And, --</p>
        <p align="left">As bats in hollow of mystic cavern, whenever any of the has dropped out of the string and falls from the rock, fly shrilling and cling to one another, so did they with shrilling cry hold together as they moved. And we must beg Homer and the other poets not to be angry if we strike out these and similar passages, not because they are unpoetical, or unattractive to the popular ear, but because the greater the poetical charm of them, the less are they meet for the ears of boys and men who are meant to be free, and who should fear slavery more than death.</p>
        <p align="left">Undoubtedly.<br>
          Also we shall have to reject all the terrible and appalling names describe the world below --Cocytus and Styx, ghosts under the earth, and sapless shades, and any similar words of which the very mention causes a shudder to pass through the inmost soul of him who hears them. I do not say that these horrible stories may not have a use of some kind; but there is a danger that the nerves of our guardians may be rendered too excitable and effeminate by them.</p>
        <p align="left">There is a real danger, he said.<br>
          Then we must have no more of them.<br>
          True.<br>
          Another and a nobler strain must be composed and sung by us.<br>
          Clearly.<br>
          And shall we proceed to get rid of the weepings and wailings of famous men?</p>
        <p align="left">They will go with the rest.<br>
          But shall we be right in getting rid of them? Reflect: our principle is that the good man will not consider death terrible to any other good man who is his comrade.</p>
        <p align="left">Yes; that is our principle.<br>
          And therefore he will not sorrow for his departed friend as though he had suffered anything terrible?</p>
        <p align="left">He will not.<br>
          Such an one, as we further maintain, is sufficient for himself and his own happiness, and therefore is least in need of other men.</p>
        <p align="left">True, he said.<br>
          And for this reason the loss of a son or brother, or the deprivation of fortune, is to him of all men least terrible.</p>
        <p align="left">Assuredly.<br>
          And therefore he will be least likely to lament, and will bear with the greatest equanimity any misfortune of this sort which may befall him.</p>
        <p align="left">Yes, he will feel such a misfortune far less than another.<br>
          Then we shall be right in getting rid of the lamentations of famous men, and making them over to women (and not even to women who are good for anything), or to men of a baser sort, that those who are being educated by us to be the defenders of their country may scorn to do the like.</p>
        <p align="left">That will be very right.<br>
          Then we will once more entreat Homer and the other poets not to depict Achilles, who is the son of a goddess, first lying on his side, then on his back, and then on his face; then starting up and sailing in a frenzy along the shores of the barren sea; now taking the sooty ashes in both his hands and pouring them over his head, or weeping and wailing in the various modes which Homer has delineated. Nor should he describe Priam the kinsman of the gods as praying and beseeching,</p>
        <p align="left">Rolling in the dirt, calling each man loudly by his name. Still more earnestly will we beg of him at all events not to introduce the gods lamenting and saying,</p>
        <p align="left">Alas! my misery! Alas! that I bore the harvest to my sorrow. But if he must introduce the gods, at any rate let him not dare so completely to misrepresent the greatest of the gods, as to make him say --</p>
        <p align="left">O heavens! with my eyes verily I behold a dear friend of mine chased round and round the city, and my heart is sorrowful. Or again: --</p>
        <p align="left">Woe is me that I am fated to have Sarpedon, dearest of men to me, subdued at the hands of Patroclus the son of Menoetius. For if, my sweet Adeimantus, our youth seriously listen to such unworthy representations of the gods, instead of laughing at them as they ought, hardly will any of them deem that he himself, being but a man, can be dishonoured by similar actions; neither will he rebuke any inclination which may arise in his mind to say and do the like. And instead of having any shame or self-control, he will be always whining and lamenting on slight occasions.</p>
        <p align="left">Yes, he said, that is most true.<br>
          Yes, I replied; but that surely is what ought not to be, as the argument has just proved to us; and by that proof we must abide until it is disproved by a better.</p>
        <p align="left">It ought not to be.<br>
          Neither ought our guardians to be given to laughter. For a fit of laughter which has been indulged to excess almost always produces a violent reaction.</p>
        <p align="left">So I believe.<br>
          Then persons of worth, even if only mortal men, must not be represented as overcome by laughter, and still less must such a representation of the gods be allowed.</p>
        <p align="left">Still less of the gods, as you say, he replied.<br>
          Then we shall not suffer such an expression to be used about the gods as that of Homer when he describes how</p>
        <p align="left">Inextinguishable laughter arose among the blessed gods, when they saw Hephaestus bustling about the mansion. On your views, we must not admit them.</p>
        <p align="left">On my views, if you like to father them on me; that we must not admit them is certain.</p>
        <p align="left">Again, truth should be highly valued; if, as we were saying, a lie is useless to the gods, and useful only as a medicine to men, then the use of such medicines should be restricted to physicians; private individuals have no business with them.</p>
        <p align="left">Clearly not, he said.<br>
          Then if any one at all is to have the privilege of lying, the rulers of the State should be the persons; and they, in their dealings either with enemies or with their own citizens, may be allowed to lie for the public good. But nobody else should meddle with anything of the kind; and although the rulers have this privilege, for a private man to lie to them in return is to be deemed a more heinous fault than for the patient or the pupil of a gymnasium not to speak the truth about his own bodily illnesses to the physician or to the trainer, or for a sailor not to tell the captain what is happening about the ship and the rest of the crew, and how things are going with himself or his fellow sailors.</p>
        <p align="left">Most true, he said.<br>
          If, then, the ruler catches anybody beside himself lying in the State,</p>
        <p align="left">Any of the craftsmen, whether he priest or physician or carpenter. he will punish him for introducing a practice which is equally subversive and destructive of ship or State.</p>
        <p align="left">Most certainly, he said, if our idea of the State is ever carried out.</p>
        <p align="left">In the next place our youth must be temperate?<br>
          Certainly.<br>
          Are not the chief elements of temperance, speaking generally, obedience to commanders and self-control in sensual pleasures?</p>
        <p align="left">True.<br>
          Then we shall approve such language as that of Diomede in Homer,</p>
        <p align="left">Friend, sit still and obey my word, and the verses which follow,</p>
        <p align="left">The Greeks marched breathing prowess,<br>
          ...in silent awe of their leaders, and other sentiments of the same kind.</p>
        <p align="left">We shall.<br>
          What of this line,</p>
        <p align="left">O heavy with wine, who hast the eyes of a dog and the heart of a stag, and of the words which follow? Would you say that these, or any similar impertinences which private individuals are supposed to address to their rulers, whether in verse or prose, are well or ill spoken?</p>
        <p align="left">They are ill spoken.<br>
          They may very possibly afford some amusement, but they do not conduce to temperance. And therefore they are likely to do harm to our young men --you would agree with me there?</p>
        <p align="left">Yes.<br>
          And then, again, to make the wisest of men say that nothing in his opinion is more glorious than</p>
        <p align="left">When the tables are full of bread and meat, and the cup-bearer carries round wine which he draws from the bowl and pours into the cups, is it fit or conducive to temperance for a young man to hear such words? Or the verse</p>
        <p align="left">The saddest of fates is to die and meet destiny from hunger? What would you say again to the tale of Zeus, who, while other gods and men were asleep and he the only person awake, lay devising plans, but forgot them all in a moment through his lust, and was so completely overcome at the sight of Here that he would not even go into the hut, but wanted to lie with her on the ground, declaring that he had never been in such a state of rapture before, even when they first met one another</p>
        <p align="left">Without the knowledge of their parents; or that other tale of how Hephaestus, because of similar goings on, cast a chain around Ares and Aphrodite?</p>
        <p align="left">Indeed, he said, I am strongly of opinion that they ought not to hear that sort of thing.</p>
        <p align="left">But any deeds of endurance which are done or told by famous men, these they ought to see and hear; as, for example, what is said in the verses,</p>
        <p align="left">He smote his breast, and thus reproached his heart,<br>
          Endure, my heart; far worse hast thou endured!</p>
        <p align="left">Certainly, he said.<br>
          In the next place, we must not let them be receivers of gifts or lovers of money.</p>
        <p align="left">Certainly not.<br>
          Neither must we sing to them of</p>
        <p align="left">Gifts persuading gods, and persuading reverend kings. Neither is Phoenix, the tutor of Achilles, to be approved or deemed to have given his pupil good counsel when he told him that he should take the gifts of the Greeks and assist them; but that without a gift he should not lay aside his anger. Neither will we believe or acknowledge Achilles himself to have been such a lover of money that he took Agamemnon's or that when he had received payment he restored the dead body of Hector, but that without payment he was unwilling to do so.</p>
        <p align="left">Undoubtedly, he said, these are not sentiments which can be approved.</p>
        <p align="left">Loving Homer as I do, I hardly like to say that in attributing these feelings to Achilles, or in believing that they are truly to him, he is guilty of downright impiety. As little can I believe the narrative of his insolence to Apollo, where he says,</p>
        <p align="left">Thou hast wronged me, O far-darter, most abominable of deities. Verily I would he even with thee, if I had only the power, or his insubordination to the river-god, on whose divinity he is ready to lay hands; or his offering to the dead Patroclus of his own hair, which had been previously dedicated to the other river-god Spercheius, and that he actually performed this vow; or that he dragged Hector round the tomb of Patroclus, and slaughtered the captives at the pyre; of all this I cannot believe that he was guilty, any more than I can allow our citizens to believe that he, the wise Cheiron's pupil, the son of a goddess and of Peleus who was the gentlest of men and third in descent from Zeus, was so disordered in his wits as to be at one time the slave of two seemingly inconsistent passions, meanness, not untainted by avarice, combined with overweening contempt of gods and men.</p>
        <p align="left">You are quite right, he replied.<br>
          And let us equally refuse to believe, or allow to be repeated, the tale of Theseus son of Poseidon, or of Peirithous son of Zeus, going forth as they did to perpetrate a horrid rape; or of any other hero or son of a god daring to do such impious and dreadful things as they falsely ascribe to them in our day: and let us further compel the poets to declare either that these acts were not done by them, or that they were not the sons of gods; --both in the same breath they shall not be permitted to affirm. We will not have them trying to persuade our youth that the gods are the authors of evil, and that heroes are no better than men-sentiments which, as we were saying, are neither pious nor true, for we have already proved that evil cannot come from the gods.</p>
        <p align="left">Assuredly not.<br>
          And further they are likely to have a bad effect on those who hear them; for everybody will begin to excuse his own vices when he is convinced that similar wickednesses are always being perpetrated by --</p>
        <p align="left">The kindred of the gods, the relatives of Zeus, whose ancestral altar, the attar of Zeus, is aloft in air on the peak of Ida, and who have</p>
        <p align="left">the blood of deities yet flowing in their veins. And therefore let us put an end to such tales, lest they engender laxity of morals among the young.</p>
        <p align="left">By all means, he replied.<br>
          But now that we are determining what classes of subjects are or are not to be spoken of, let us see whether any have been omitted by us. The manner in which gods and demigods and heroes and the world below should be treated has been already laid down.</p>
        <p align="left">Very true.<br>
          And what shall we say about men? That is clearly the remaining portion of our subject.</p>
        <p align="left">Clearly so.<br>
          But we are not in a condition to answer this question at present, my friend.</p>
        <p align="left">Why not?<br>
          Because, if I am not mistaken, we shall have to say that about men poets and story-tellers are guilty of making the gravest misstatements when they tell us that wicked men are often happy, and the good miserable; and that injustice is profitable when undetected, but that justice is a man's own loss and another's gain --these things we shall forbid them to utter, and command them to sing and say the opposite.</p>
        <p align="left">To be sure we shall, he replied.<br>
          But if you admit that I am right in this, then I shall maintain that you have implied the principle for which we have been all along contending.</p>
        <p align="left">I grant the truth of your inference.<br>
          That such things are or are not to be said about men is a question which we cannot determine until we have discovered what justice is, and how naturally advantageous to the possessor, whether he seems to be just or not.</p>
        <p align="left">Most true, he said.<br>
          Enough of the subjects of poetry: let us now speak of the style; and when this has been considered, both matter and manner will have been completely treated.</p>
        <p align="left">I do not understand what you mean, said Adeimantus.<br>
          Then I must make you understand; and perhaps I may be more intelligible if I put the matter in this way. You are aware, I suppose, that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or to come?</p>
        <p align="left">Certainly, he replied.<br>
          And narration may be either simple narration, or imitation, or a union of the two?</p>
        <p align="left">That again, he said, I do not quite understand.<br>
          I fear that I must be a ridiculous teacher when I have so much difficulty in making myself apprehended. Like a bad speaker, therefore, I will not take the whole of the subject, but will break a piece off in illustration of my meaning. You know the first lines of the Iliad, in which the poet says that Chryses prayed Agamemnon to release his daughter, and that Agamemnon flew into a passion with him; whereupon Chryses, failing of his object, invoked the anger of the God against the Achaeans. Now as far as these lines,</p>
        <p align="left">And he prayed all the Greeks, but especially the two sons of Atreus, the chiefs of the people, the poet is speaking in his own person; he never leads us to suppose that he is any one else. But in what follows he takes the person of Chryses, and then he does all that he can to make us believe that the speaker is not Homer, but the aged priest himself. And in this double form he has cast the entire narrative of the events which occurred at Troy and in Ithaca and throughout the Odyssey.</p>
        <p align="left">Yes.<br>
          And a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites from time to time and in the intermediate passages?</p>
        <p align="left">Quite true.<br>
          But when the poet speaks in the person of another, may we not say that he assimilates his style to that of the person who, as he informs you, is going to speak?</p>
        <p align="left">Certainly.<br>
          And this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture, is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes?</p>
        <p align="left">Of course.<br>
          Then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by way of imitation?</p>
        <p align="left">Very true.<br>
          Or, if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself, then again the imitation is dropped, and his poetry becomes simple narration. However, in order that I may make my meaning quite clear, and that you may no more say, I don't understand,' I will show how the change might be effected. If Homer had said, 'The priest came, having his daughter's ransom in his hands, supplicating the Achaeans, and above all the kings;' and then if, instead of speaking in the person of Chryses, he had continued in his own person, the words would have been, not imitation, but simple narration. The passage would have run as follows (I am no poet, and therefore I drop the metre), 'The priest came and prayed the gods on behalf of the Greeks that they might capture Troy and return safely home, but begged that they would give him back his daughter, and take the ransom which he brought, and respect the God. Thus he spoke, and the other Greeks revered the priest and assented. But Agamemnon was wroth, and bade him depart and not come again, lest the staff and chaplets of the God should be of no avail to him --the daughter of Chryses should not be released, he said --she should grow old with him in Argos. And then he told him to go away and not to provoke him, if he intended to get home unscathed. And the old man went away in fear and silence, and, when he had left the camp, he called upon Apollo by his many names, reminding him of everything which he had done pleasing to him, whether in building his temples, or in offering sacrifice, and praying that his good deeds might be returned to him, and that the Achaeans might expiate his tears by the arrows of the god,' --and so on. In this way the whole becomes simple narrative.</p>
        <p align="left">I understand, he said.<br>
          Or you may suppose the opposite case --that the intermediate passages are omitted, and the dialogue only left.</p>
        <p align="left">That also, he said, I understand; you mean, for example, as in tragedy.</p>
        <p align="left">You have conceived my meaning perfectly; and if I mistake not, what you failed to apprehend before is now made clear to you, that poetry and mythology are, in some cases, wholly imitative --instances of this are supplied by tragedy and comedy; there is likewise the opposite style, in which the my poet is the only speaker --of this the dithyramb affords the best example; and the combination of both is found in epic, and in several other styles of poetry. Do I take you with me?</p>
        <p align="left">Yes, he said; I see now what you meant.<br>
          I will ask you to remember also what I began by saying, that we had done with the subject and might proceed to the style.</p>
        <p align="left">Yes, I remember.<br>
          In saying this, I intended to imply that we must come to an understanding about the mimetic art, --whether the poets, in narrating their stories, are to be allowed by us to imitate, and if so, whether in whole or in part, and if the latter, in what parts; or should all imitation be prohibited?</p>
        <p align="left">You mean, I suspect, to ask whether tragedy and comedy shall be admitted into our State?</p>
        <p align="left">Yes, I said; but there may be more than this in question: I really do not know as yet, but whither the argument may blow, thither we go.</p>
        <p align="left">And go we will, he said.<br>
          Then, Adeimantus, let me ask you whether our guardians ought to be imitators; or rather, has not this question been decided by the rule already laid down that one man can only do one thing well, and not many; and that if he attempt many, he will altogether fall of gaining much reputation in any?</p>
        <p align="left">Certainly.<br>
          And this is equally true of imitation; no one man can imitate many things as well as he would imitate a single one?</p>
        <p align="left">He cannot.<br>
          Then the same person will hardly be able to play a serious part in life, and at the same time to be an imitator and imitate many other parts as well; for even when two species of imitation are nearly allied, the same persons cannot succeed in both, as, for example, the writers of tragedy and comedy --did you not just now call them imitations?</p>
        <p align="left">Yes, I did; and you are right in thinking that the same persons cannot succeed in both.</p>
        <p align="left">Any more than they can be rhapsodists and actors at once?<br>
          True.<br>
          Neither are comic and tragic actors the same; yet all these things are but imitations.</p>
        <p align="left">They are so.<br>
          And human nature, Adeimantus, appears to have been coined into yet smaller pieces, and to be as incapable of imitating many things well, as of performing well the actions of which the imitations are copies.</p>
        <p align="left">Quite true, he replied.<br>
          If then we adhere to our original notion and bear in mind that our guardians, setting aside every other business, are to dedicate themselves wholly to the maintenance of freedom in the State, making this their craft, and engaging in no work which does not bear on this end, they ought not to practise or imitate anything else; if they imitate at all, they should imitate from youth upward only those characters which are suitable to their profession --the courageous, temperate, holy, free, and the like; but they should not depict or be skilful at imitating any kind of illiberality or baseness, lest from imitation they should come to be what they imitate. Did you never observe how imitations, beginning in early youth and continuing far into life, at length grow into habits and become a second nature, affecting body, voice, and mind?</p>
        <p align="left">Yes, certainly, he said.<br>
          Then, I said, we will not allow those for whom we profess a care and of whom we say that they ought to be good men, to imitate a woman, whether young or old, quarrelling with her husband, or striving and vaunting against the gods in conceit of her happiness, or when she is in affliction, or sorrow, or weeping; and certainly not one who is in sickness, love, or labour.</p>
        <p align="left">Very right, he said.<br>
          Neither must they represent slaves, male or female, performing the offices of slaves?</p>
        <p align="left">They must not.<br>
          And surely not bad men, whether cowards or any others, who do the reverse of what we have just been prescribing, who scold or mock or revile one another in drink or out of in drink or, or who in any other manner sin against themselves and their neighbours in word or deed, as the manner of such is. Neither should they be trained to imitate the action or speech of men or women who are mad or bad; for madness, like vice, is to be known but not to be practised or imitated.</p>
        <p align="left">Very true, he replied.<br>
          Neither may they imitate smiths or other artificers, or oarsmen, or boatswains, or the like?</p>
        <p align="left">How can they, he said, when they are not allowed to apply their minds to the callings of any of these?</p>
        <p align="left">Nor may they imitate the neighing of horses, the bellowing of bulls, the murmur of rivers and roll of the ocean, thunder, and all that sort of thing?</p>
        <p align="left">Nay, he said, if madness be forbidden, neither may they copy the behaviour of madmen.</p>
        <p align="left">You mean, I said, if I understand you aright, that there is one sort of narrative style which may be employed by a truly good man when he has anything to say, and that another sort will be used by a man of an opposite character and education.</p>
        <p align="left">And whAnd which are these two sorts? he asked.<br>
          Suppose, I answered, that a just and good man in the course of a narration comes on some saying or action of another good man, --I should imagine that he will like to personate him, and will not be ashamed of this sort of imitation: he will be most ready to play the part of the good man when he is acting firmly and wisely; in a less degree when he is overtaken by illness or love or drink, or has met with any other disaster. But when he comes to a character which is unworthy of him, he will not make a study of that; he will disdain such a person, and will assume his likeness, if at all, for a moment only when he is performing some good action; at other times he will be ashamed to play a part which he has never practised, nor will he like to fashion and frame himself after the baser models; he feels the employment of such an art, unless in jest, to be beneath him, and his mind revolts at it.</p>
        <p align="left">So I should expect, he replied.<br>
          Then he will adopt a mode of narration such as we have illustrated out of Homer, that is to say, his style will be both imitative and narrative; but there will be very little of the former, and a great deal of the latter. Do you agree?</p>
        <p align="left">Certainly, he said; that is the model which such a speaker must necessarily take.</p>
        <p align="left">But there is another sort of character who will narrate anything, and, the worse lie is, the more unscrupulous he will be; nothing will be too bad for him: and he will be ready to imitate anything, not as a joke, but in right good earnest, and before a large company. As I was just now saying, he will attempt to represent the roll of thunder, the noise of wind and hall, or the creaking of wheels, and pulleys, and the various sounds of flutes; pipes, trumpets, and all sorts of instruments: he will bark like a dog, bleat like a sheep, or crow like a cock; his entire art will consist in imitation of voice and gesture, and there will be very little narration.</p>
        <p align="left">That, he said, will be his mode of speaking.<br>
          These, then, are the two kinds of style?<br>
          Yes.<br>
          And you would agree with me in saying that one of them is simple and has but slight changes; and if the harmony and rhythm are also chosen for their simplicity, the result is that the speaker, if hc speaks correctly, is always pretty much the same in style, and he will keep within the limits of a single harmony (for the changes are not great), and in like manner he will make use of nearly the same rhythm?</p>
        <p align="left">That is quite true, he said.<br>
          Whereas the other requires all sorts of harmonies and all sorts of rhythms, if the music and the style are to correspond, because the style has all sorts of changes.</p>
        <p align="left">That is also perfectly true, he replied.<br>
          And do not the two styles, or the mixture of the two, comprehend all poetry, and every form of expression in words? No one can say anything except in one or other of them or in both together.</p>
        <p align="left">They include all, he said.<br>
          And shall we receive into our State all the three styles, or one only of the two unmixed styles? or would you include the mixed?</p>
        <p align="left">I should prefer only to admit the pure imitator of virtue.<br>
          Yes, I said, Adeimantus, but the mixed style is also very charming: and indeed the pantomimic, which is the opposite of the one chosen by you, is the most popular style with children and their attendants, and with the world in general.</p>
        <p align="left">I do not deny it.<br>
          But I suppose you would argue that such a style is unsuitable to our State, in which human nature is not twofold or manifold, for one man plays one part only?</p>
        <p align="left">Yes; quite unsuitable.<br>
          And this is the reason why in our State, and in our State only, we shall find a shoemaker to be a shoemaker and not a pilot also, and a husbandman to be a husbandman and not a dicast also, and a soldier a soldier and not a trader also, and the same throughout?</p>
        <p align="left">True, he said.<br>
          And therefore when any one of these pantomimic gentlemen, who are so clever that they can imitate anything, comes to us, and makes a proposal to exhibit himself and his poetry, we will fall down and worship him as a sweet and holy and wonderful being; but we must also inform him that in our State such as he are not permitted to exist; the law will not allow them. And so when we have anointed him with myrrh, and set a garland of wool upon his head, we shall send him away to another city. For we mean to employ for our souls' health the rougher and severer poet or story-teller, who will imitate the style of the virtuous only, and will follow those models which we prescribed at first when we began the education of our soldiers.</p>
        <p align="left">We certainly will, he said, if we have the power.<br>
          Then now, my friend, I said, that part of music or literary education which relates to the story or myth may be considered to be finished; for the matter and manner have both been discussed. </p>
