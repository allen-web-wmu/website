            <p>&sect; IV. And some laughter ensuing, Protogenes replied, &quot;Do I really seem<br>
              to you now to be hostile to love, and not to be fighting for love<br>
              against ungovernable lust, which with most disgraceful acts and emotions<br>
              assumes the most honourable of titles?&quot; Whereupon Daphn&aelig;us, &quot;Do you call<br>
              the marriage and union of man and woman most disgraceful, than which no<br>
              holier tie exists nor ever did?&quot; Protogenes replied, &quot;Why, as all this<br>
              is necessary for the human race to continue, our legislators do not act<br>
              amiss in crying up marriage and eulogizing it to the masses, but of<br>
              genuine love there is not a particle in the woman's side of a house;[64]<br>
              and I also say that you who are sweet on women and girls only love them<br>
              as flies love milk, and bees the honey-comb, and butchers and cooks<br>
              calves and birds, fattening them up in darkness.[65] But as nature leads<br>
              one to eat and drink moderately and sufficiently, and excess in this is<br>
              called gluttony and gormandizing, so the mutual desires between men and<br>
              women are natural; but that headlong, violent, and uncontrollable<br>
              passion for the sex is not rightly called love. For love, when it seizes<br>
              a noble and young soul, ends in virtue through friendship; but these<br>
              violent passions for women, at the best, aim only at carnal enjoyment<br>
              and reaping the harvest of a beauteous prime, as Aristippus showed in<br>
              his answer to one who told him Lais loved him not, 'No more,' he said,<br>
              'do meat and wine love me, but I gladly enjoy both.'[66] For the end of<br>
              passion is pleasure and fruition: but love, when it has once lost the<br>
              promise of friendship, will not remain and continue to cherish merely<br>
              for beauty that which gives it pain, where it gives no return of<br>
              friendship and virtue. You remember the husband in the play saying to<br>
              his wife, 'Do you hate me? I can bear that hatred very easily, since of<br>
              my dishonour I make money.' Not a whit more really in love than this<br>
              husband is the one, who, not for gain but merely for the sexual<br>
              appetite, puts up with a peevish and unsympathetic wife, as Philippides,<br>
              the comic poet, ridiculed the orator, Stratocles, 'You scarce can kiss<br>
              her if she turns her back on you.' If, however, we ought to give the<br>
              name of love to this passion, then is it an effeminate and bastard love,<br>
              and like at Cynosarges,[67] taking us to the woman's side of the house:<br>
              or rather as they say there is a genuine mountain eagle, which Homer<br>
              called 'black, and a bird of prey,' and there are other kinds of<br>
              spurious eagles, which catch fish and lazy birds in marshes, and often<br>
              in want of food emit an hungry wail: so the genuine love is the love of<br>
              boys, a love not 'flashing with desire,' as Anacreon said the love of<br>
              maidens was, nor 'redolent of ointment and sprightly,' but you will see<br>
              it plain and without airs in the schools of the philosophers, or perhaps<br>
              in the gymnasiums and wrestling-schools, keenly and nobly pursuing<br>
              youths, and urging on to virtue those who are well worthy of attention:<br>
              but that soft and stay-at-home love, spending all its time in women's<br>
              bosoms and beds, always pursuing effeminate delights, and enervated by<br>
              unmanly, unfriendly, and unimpassioned pleasures, we ought to condemn as<br>
              Solon condemned it: for he forbade slaves to love boys or to anoint them<br>
              with oil, while he allowed them to associate with women. For friendship<br>
              is noble and refined, whereas pleasure is vulgar and illiberal.<br>
              Therefore, for a slave to love boys is neither liberal or refined: for<br>
            it is merely the love of copulation, as the love of women.&quot;</p>
            <p>&sect; V. Protogenes was intending to go on at greater length, when Daphn&aelig;us<br>
              stopped him and said, &quot;You do well, by Zeus, to mention Solon, and we<br>
              too may use him as the test of an amorous man. Does he not define such a<br>
              one in the lines, 'As long as you love boys in the glorious flower of<br>
              their youth for their kisses and embraces.' And add to Solon the lines<br>
              of &AElig;schylus, 'You did not disdain the honour of the thighs, O thankless<br>
              one after all my frequent kisses.'[68] For some laugh at them if they<br>
              bid lovers, like sacrificing priests and seers, to inspect thighs and<br>
              loins; but I think this a mighty argument in behalf of the love of<br>
              women. For if the unnatural commerce with males does not take away or<br>
              mar the amorous propensity, much more likely is it that the natural love<br>
              of women will end in friendship after the favour. For, Protogenes, the<br>
              yielding of the female to the male was called by the ancients the<br>
              favour. Thus Pindar says Heph&aelig;stus was the son of Hera 'without any<br>
              favours':[69] and Sappho, addressing a girl not yet ripe for marriage,<br>
              says to her, 'You seemed to me a little girl, too young for the favour.'<br>
              And someone asks Hercules, 'Did you obtain the girl's favour by force or<br>
              by persuasion?' But the love of males for males, whether rape or<br>
              voluntary--pathicks effeminately submitting, to use Plato's words, 'to<br>
              be treated bestially'--is altogether a foul and unlovely favour. And so<br>
              I think Solon wrote the lines quoted above 'in his hot youth,' as Plato<br>
              puts it; but when he became older wrote these other lines, 'Now I<br>
              delight in Cyprus-born Aphrodite, and in Dionysus, and in the Muses: all<br>
              these give joys to men': as if, after the heat and tempest of his boyish<br>
              loves, he had got into a quiet haven of marriage and philosophy. But<br>
              indeed, Protogenes, if we look at the real facts of the case, the love<br>
              for boys and women is really one and the same passion: but if you wish<br>
              in a disputatious spirit to make any distinction, you will find that<br>
              this boy-love goes beyond all bounds, and, like some late-born and<br>
              ill-begotten bastard brat, seeks to expel its legitimate brother the<br>
              older love, the love of women. For indeed, friend, it is only yesterday<br>
              or the day before, since the strippings and exposures of the youths in<br>
              the gymnasiums, that this boy-love crept in, and gently insinuated<br>
              itself and got a footing, and at last in a little time got fully-fledged<br>
              in the wrestling-schools, and has now got fairly unbearable, and insults<br>
              and tramples on conjugal love, that love that gives immortality to our<br>
              mortal race, when our nature has been extinguished by death, kindling it<br>
              again by new births. And this boy-love denies that pleasure is its aim:<br>
              for it is ashamed and afraid to confess the truth: but it needs some<br>
              specious excuse for the liberties it takes with handsome boys in their<br>
              prime: the pretext is friendship and virtue. So your boy-lover wallows<br>
              in the dust, bathes in cold water, raises his eyebrows, gives himself<br>
              out for a philosopher, and lives chaste abroad because of the law: but<br>
            in the stillness of night</p>
            <p> 'Sweet is the ripe fruit when the guard's withdrawn.'[70]</p>
            <p>But if, as Protogenes says, there is no carnal intercourse in these<br>
              boy-familiarities, how is it Love, if Aphrodite is not present, whom it<br>
              is the destiny of Love to cherish and pay court to, and to partake of<br>
              just as much honour and power as she assigns to him? But if there is any<br>
              Love without Aphrodite, as there is drunkenness without wine in drinks<br>
              made from figs and barley, the disturbing it will be fruitless and<br>
              without effect, and surfeiting and disgusting.&quot;</p>
            <p>&sect; VI. At the conclusion of this speech, it was clear that Pisias was<br>
              vexed and indignant with Daphn&aelig;us; and after a moment's silence he<br>
              began: &quot;O Hercules! what levity and audacity for men to state that they<br>
              are tied to women as dogs to bitches, and to banish the god of Love from<br>
              the gymnasiums and public walks, and light of day and open intercourse,<br>
              and to restrict him to brothels[71] and philtres and incantations of<br>
              wanton women: for to chaste women, I am sure, it belongs not either to<br>
              love or be loved.&quot; At this point our father told me he interposed, and<br>
            took Protogenes by the hand, and said to him:</p>
            <p> &quot;'This word of yours rouses the Argive host,'</p>
            <p>and of a verity Pisias makes us to side with Daphn&aelig;us by his extravagant<br>
              language, charging marriage with being a loveless intercourse, and one<br>
              that has no participation in divine friendship, although we can see that<br>
              it is an intercourse, if erotic persuasion and favour fail, that cannot<br>
              be restrained by shame and fear as by bit and bridle.&quot; Thereupon Pisias<br>
              said, &quot;I care little about his arguments; but I see that Daphn&aelig;us is in<br>
              the same condition as brass: for, just as it is not worked upon so much<br>
              by the agency of fire as by the molten and liquid brass fused with it,<br>
              so is he not so much captivated by the beauty of Lysandra as by his<br>
              association with one who is the victim of the gentle passion; and it is<br>
              plain that, if he doesn't take refuge with us, he will soon melt away<br>
              in the flame altogether. But I see, what Anthemion would very much like,<br>
              that I am offending the Court, so I stop.&quot; &quot;You amuse us,&quot; said<br>
              Anthemion: &quot;but you ought from the first to have spoken to the point.&quot;</p>
            <p>&sect; VII. &quot;I say then,&quot; continued Pisias, &quot;and give it out boldly, as far<br>
              as I am concerned, let every woman have a lover; but we ought to guard<br>
              against giving the wealth of Ismenodora to Baccho, lest, if we involve<br>
              him in so much grandeur and magnificence, we unwittingly lose him in it,<br>
              as tin is lost in brass. For if the lad were to marry quite a plain and<br>
              insignificant woman, it would be great odds whether he would keep the<br>
              upper hand, as wine mixed with water; and Ismenodora seems already<br>
              marked out for sway and command; for otherwise she would not have<br>
              rejected such illustrious and wealthy suitors to woo a lad hardly yet<br>
              arrived at man's estate, and almost requiring a tutor still. And<br>
              therefore men of sense prune the excessive wealth of their wives, as if<br>
              it had wings that required clipping; for this same wealth implants in<br>
              them luxury, caprice, and vanity, by which they are often elated and fly<br>
              away altogether: but if they remain, it would be better to be bound by<br>
              golden fetters, as in Ethiopia, than to a woman's wealth.&quot;</p>
            <p>&sect; VIII. Here Protogenes put in, &quot;You say nothing about the risk we run<br>
              of unseasonably and ridiculously reversing the well-known advice of<br>
              Hesiod:</p>
            <p> 'If seasonable marriage you would make,<br>
              Let about thirty be the bridegroom's age,<br>
              The bride be in the fifth year of her womanhood:'[72]</p>
            <p>if we thus marry a lad hardly old enough for marriage to a woman so many<br>
              years older, than himself, as dates and figs are forced. You will say<br>
              she loves him passionately: who prevents her, then, from serenading at<br>
              his doors, singing her amorous ditty, putting garlands on his statues,<br>
              and wrestling and boxing with her rivals in his affections? For all<br>
              these are what people in love do. And let her lower her eyebrows, and<br>
              give up the airs of a coquette, and assume the appearance of those that<br>
              are deeply smitten. But if she is modest and chaste, let her decorously<br>
              stay at home and await there her lovers and sweethearts; for any<br>
              sensible man would be disgusted and flee from a woman who took the<br>
              initiative in love, far less would he be likely to marry her after such<br>
            a barefaced wooing.&quot; ...</p>
            <p>&sect; XXI. * * * Now the origins and causes of Love are not peculiar to<br>
              either sex, but common to both. For those attractions that make men<br>
              amorous may as well proceed from women as from boys.[131] And as to<br>
              those beautiful and holy reminiscences and invitations to the divine and<br>
              genuine and Olympian beauty, by which the soul soars aloft, what hinders<br>
              but that they may come either from boys or lads, maidens or grown women,<br>
              whenever a chaste and orderly nature and beauteous prime are associated<br>
              together (just as a neat shoe exhibits the shapeliness of the foot, to<br>
              borrow the illustration of Aristo), whenever connoisseurs of beauty<br>
              descry in beautiful forms and pure bodies clear traces of an upright and<br>
              unenervated soul.[132] For if[133] the man of pleasure, who was asked<br>
              whether &quot;he was most given to the love of women or boys,&quot; and answered,<br>
              &quot;I care not which so beauty be but there,&quot; is considered to have given<br>
              an appropriate answer as to his erotic desires, shall the noble lover of<br>
              beauty neglect beauty and nobility of nature, and make love only with an<br>
              eye to the sexual parts? Why, the lover of horses will take just as much<br>
              pleasure in the good points of Podargus, as in those of &AElig;the,<br>
              Agamemnon's mare,[134] and the sportsman rejoices not only in dogs, but<br>
              also rears Cretan and Spartan bitches,[135] and shall the lover of the<br>
              beautiful and of humanity be unfair and deal unequally with either sex,<br>
              and think that the difference between the loves of boys and women is<br>
              only their different dress? And yet they say that beauty is a flower of<br>
              virtue; and it is ridiculous to assert that the female sex never<br>
            blossoms nor make a goodly show of virtue, for as &AElig;schylus truly says,</p>
            <p> 'I never can mistake the burning eye<br>
              Of the young woman that has once known man.'[136]</p>
            <p>Shall the indications then of a forward wanton and corrupt character be<br>
              found in the faces of women, and shall there be no gleam of chastity and<br>
              modesty in their appearance? Nay, there are many such, and shall they<br>
              not move and provoke love? To doubt it would be neither sensible nor in<br>
              accordance with the facts, for generally speaking, as has been pointed<br>
              out, all these attractions are the same in both sexes.... But, Daphn&aelig;us,<br>
              let us combat those views which Zeuxippus lately advanced, making Love<br>
              to be only irregular desire carrying the soul away to licentiousness,<br>
              not that this was so much his own view as what he had often heard from<br>
              morose men who knew nothing of love: some of whom marry unfortunate<br>
              women for their dowries, and force on them economy and illiberal saving,<br>
              and quarrel with them every day of their lives: while others, more<br>
              desirous of children than wives, when they have made those women they<br>
              come across mothers, bid farewell to marriage, or regard it not at all,<br>
              and neither care to love nor be loved. Now the fact that the word for<br>
              conjugal love differs only by one letter from the word for endurance,<br>
              the one being [Greek: stergein] the other [Greek: stegein], seems to<br>
              emphasize the conjugal kindness mixed by time and intimacy with<br>
              necessity. But that marriage which Love has inspired will in the first<br>
              place, as in Plato's Republic, know nothing of _Meum_ and _Tuum_, for<br>
              the proverb, 'whatever belongs to a friend is common property,'[137] is<br>
              especially true of married persons who, though disunited in body, are<br>
              perforce one in soul, neither wishing to be two, nor thinking themselves<br>
              so. In the second place there will be mutual respect, which is a vital<br>
              necessity in marriage. For as to that external respect which has in it<br>
              more of compulsion than choice, being forced by the law and shame and<br>
              fear,</p>
            <p> &quot;Those needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,&quot;[138]</p>
            <p>that will always exist in wedlock. But in Love there is such<br>
              self-control and decorum and constancy, that if the god but once enter<br>
              the soul of a licentious man, he makes him give up all his amours,<br>
              abates his pride, and breaks down his haughtiness and dissoluteness,<br>
              putting in their place modesty and silence and tranquillity and decorum,<br>
              and makes him constant to one. You have heard of course of the famous<br>
              courtesan Lais,[139] how she set all Greece on fire with her charms, or<br>
              rather was contended for by two seas,[140] and how, when she fell in<br>
              love with Hippolochus the Thessalian, 'she left Acro-Corinthus washed by<br>
              the green sea,'[141] and deserted all her other lovers, that great army,<br>
              and went off to Thessaly and lived faithful to Hippolochus. But the<br>
              women there, envious and jealous of her for her surpassing beauty,<br>
              dragged her into the temple of Aphrodite, and there stoned her to death,<br>
              for which reason probably it is called to this day the temple of<br>
              Aphrodite the Murderess.[142] We have also heard of servant girls who<br>
              have refused the embraces of their masters, and of private individuals<br>
              who have scorned an amour with queens, when Love has had dominion in<br>
              their hearts. For as in Rome, when a dictator is proclaimed, all other<br>
              magistrates lay down their offices, so those over whom Love is lord are<br>
              free henceforward from all other lords and masters, and pass the rest of<br>
              their lives dedicate to the god and slaves in his temple. For a noble<br>
              woman united by Love to her lawful husband would prefer the embraces of<br>
              bears and dragons to those of any other man.&quot;</p>
            <p>&sect; XXII. &quot;Although there are plenty of examples of this virtue of<br>
              constancy, yet to you, that are the festive votaries of the god,[143] it<br>
              will not be amiss to relate the story of the Galatian Camma. She was a<br>
              woman of most remarkable beauty, and the wife of the tetrarch Sinatus,<br>
              whom Sinorix, one of the most influential men in Galatia, and<br>
              desperately in love with Camma, murdered, as he could neither get her by<br>
              force or persuasion in the lifetime of her husband. And Camma found a<br>
              refuge and comfort in her grief in discharging the functions of<br>
              hereditary priestess to Artemis, and most of her time she spent in her<br>
              temple, and, though many kings and potentates wooed her, she refused<br>
              them all. But when Sinorix boldly proposed marriage to her, she declined<br>
              not his offer, nor blamed him for what he had done, as though she<br>
              thought he had only murdered Sinatus out of excessive love for her, and<br>
              not in sheer villany. He came, therefore, with confidence, and asked her<br>
              hand, and she met him and greeted him and led him to the altar of the<br>
              goddess, and pledged him in a cup of poisoned mead, drinking half of it<br>
              herself and giving him the rest. And when she saw that he had drunk it<br>
              up, she shouted aloud for joy, and calling upon the name of her dead<br>
              husband, said, 'Till this day, dearest husband, I have lived, deprived<br>
              of you, a life of sorrow: but now take me to yourself with joy, for I<br>
              have avenged you on the worst of men, as glad to share death with him as<br>
              life with you.' Then Sinorix was removed out of the temple on a litter,<br>
              and soon after gave up the ghost, and Camma lived the rest of that day<br>
              and following night, and is said to have died with a good courage and<br>
            even with gaiety.&quot;[144]</p>
            <p>&sect; XXIII. &quot;As many similar examples might be adduced, both among<br>
              ourselves and foreigners, who can feel any patience with those that<br>
              reproach Aphrodite with hindering friendship when she associates herself<br>
              with Love as a partner? Whereas any reflecting person would call the<br>
            love of boys wanton and gross lasciviousness, and say with the poet:</p>
            <p> 'This is an outrage, not an act of love.'</p>
            <p>All willing pathics, therefore, we consider the vilest of mankind, and<br>
              credit them with neither fidelity, nor modesty, nor friendship, for as<br>
              Sophocles says:</p>
            <p> 'Those who shall lose such friends may well be glad,<br>
              And those who have such pray that they may lose them,'[145]</p>
            <p>But as for those who, not being by nature vicious, have been seduced or<br>
              forced, they are apt all their life to despise and hate their seducers,<br>
              and when an opportunity has presented itself to take fierce vengeance.<br>
              As Crateus, who murdered Archelaus, and Pytholaus, who murdered<br>
              Alexander of Pher&aelig;. And Periander, the tyrant of the Ambraciotes,<br>
              having asked a most insulting question of his minion, was murdered by<br>
              him, so exasperated was he. But with women and wives all this is the<br>
              beginning of friendship, and as it were an initiation into the sacred<br>
              mysteries. And pleasure plays a very small part in this, but the esteem<br>
              and favour and mutual love and constancy that result from it, proves<br>
              that the Delphians did not talk nonsense in giving the name of Arma[146]<br>
              to Aphrodite, nor Homer in giving the name of friendship[147] to sexual<br>
              love, and testifies to the fact that Solon was a most experienced<br>
              legislator in conjugal matters, seeing that he ordered husbands not less<br>
              than thrice a month to associate with their wives, not for pleasure, but<br>
              as states at certain intervals renew their treaties with one another, so<br>
              he wished that by such friendliness marriage should, as it were, be<br>
              renewed after any intervening tiffs and differences. But you will tell<br>
              me there is much folly and even madness in the love of women. Is there<br>
              not more extravagance in the love of boys?</p>
            <p> 'Seeing my many rivals I grow faint.<br>
              The lad is beardless, smooth and soft and handsome,<br>
              O that I might in his embraces die,<br>
              And have the fact recorded on my tomb.'</p>
            <p>Such extravagant language as this is madness not love. And it is absurd<br>
              to detract from woman's various excellence. Look at their self-restraint<br>
              and intelligence, their fidelity and uprightness, and that bravery<br>
              courage and magnanimity so conspicuous in many! And to say that they<br>
              have a natural aptitude for all other virtues, but are deficient as<br>
              regards friendship alone, is monstrous. For they are fond of their<br>
              children and husbands, and generally speaking the natural affection in<br>
              them is not only, like a fruitful soil, capable of friendship, but is<br>
              also accompanied by persuasion and other graces. And as poetry gives to<br>
              words a kind of relish by melody and metre and rhythm, making<br>
              instruction thereby more interesting, but what is injurious more<br>
              insidious, so nature, investing woman with beautiful appearance and<br>
              attractive voice and bewitching figure, does much for a licentious woman<br>
              in making her wiles more formidable, but makes a modest one more apt<br>
              thereby to win the goodwill and friendship of her husband. And as Plato<br>
              advised Xenocrates, a great and noble man in all other respects, but too<br>
              austere in his temperament, to sacrifice to the Graces, so one might<br>
              recommend a good and modest woman to sacrifice to Love, that her husband<br>
              might be a mild and agreeable partner, and not run after any other<br>
              woman, so as to be compelled to say like the fellow in the comedy, 'What<br>
              a wretch I am to ill-treat such a woman!' For to love in marriage is far<br>
              better than to be loved, for it prevents many, nay all, of those<br>
              offences which spoil and mar marriage. ...</p>
            <p>&sect; XXVI. Here my father said that the conversation about Love which took<br>
              place at Thespi&aelig; ended. And at this moment Diogenes, one of Pisias'<br>
              companions, was noticed coming up at a faster pace than walking. And<br>
              while he was yet a little way off, Soclarus hailed him with, &quot;You don't<br>
              announce war, Diogenes,&quot; and he replied, &quot;Hush! it is a marriage; come<br>
              with me quickly, for the sacrifice only waits for you.&quot; All were<br>
              delighted, and Zeuxippus asked if Pisias was still against the marriage.<br>
              &quot;As he was first to oppose it,&quot; said Diogenes, &quot;so he was first to yield<br>
              the victory to Ismenodora, and he has now put on a crown and robed<br>
              himself in white, so as to take his place at the head of the procession<br>
              to the god through the market-place.&quot; &quot;Come,&quot; said my father, &quot;in<br>
              Heaven's name, let us go and laugh at him, and worship the god; for it<br>
              is clear that the god has taken delight in what has happened, and been<br>
            propitious.&quot; </p>
