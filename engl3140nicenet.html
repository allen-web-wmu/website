        Conference</strong></font></font>        
<p align="left">Our computer conference, hosted at <a href="http://www.nicenet.org">Nicenet.org</a>, will add a rich on-line discussion forum to our course. Your entries should be thoughtful and respond to the ideas 
          of other students. Reading and responding to other student entries is as important as entering 
          your own responses. 
        <p align="left">The idea is not just to respond once to a topic and then move on, never to return. The idea is to read carefully other posts, respond, go to other items, return to the earlier item the next day or a couple of days later on, respond to new posts, look for new items, return to the first item again, respond again, and so on. In this way rich, interactive discussion develops, and a conversation started near the beginning of the class might grow and grow over the course of the whole semester.
        <p align="left">It is important to start early and keep up with the conference. 
          Use professional manners, while being informal at the same time. Don't 
          &quot;flame&quot; other people's responses -- it is often a good idea 
          to reread an entire item before reacting too quickly to an upsetting 
          comment from another student. </p>
        <p align="left">It is important to learn how to <a href="engl480nicenetweblinks.html">post live links in your Nicenet messages</a> and connect your comments to websites and on-line resources.</p>
        <p align="left">Enter 3-4 posts per week to earn an &quot;A&quot; on this  component 
          of class participation. Enter at least one post per class period for a &quot;C.&quot; </p>
        <p align="left">I recommend: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <div align="left">post at least one message that is at least 100 words, or more for every class meeting</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div align="left">write at least 3 additional replys directly to other people's posts</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div align="left">write messages that engage in a &quot;discussion&quot;</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div align="left">post your message up 24 hours before class</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div align="left">visit more than once so you can see (and write messages or reply) to what others have written</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div align="left">after a given class meeting that the item refers to the topic is not &quot;dead&quot; --  you are encouraged to return and continue the discussion after class has met</div>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p align="left">Future teachers should notice that  Nicenet is a free, educational site that can be also be used with   middle school and high school students. On-line discussions can take a great variety of forms, be put to many purposes, and be held to different standards. There are a variety of tools beyond Nicenet for these forums, including built-in programs in Blackboard/WebCT and Moodle. Be mindful of how this electronic conference format extends 
          our discussions because you may want to consider other <a href="http://www.wmich.edu/teachenglish/subpages/community/comresources.html">E-Community Resources</a>.</p>
        <p align="left">A full explanation of how to integrate on-line discussion, particularly Nicenet, into literature teaching is available in chapter two of my book <em><a href="http://books.heinemann.com/products/E02147.aspx">Literature and the Web:</a> Reading and Responding with New Technologies</em>.        </p>
