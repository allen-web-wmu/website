          Presentation / Workshop
          </font></font></h1>
        <p align="left">The purpose of these presentations / activities is to 
        <ul>
          <li>
            <div align="left">allow you to research an issue in the teaching of writing that you are interested in;        </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div align="left">increase the knowledge of the class about how to teach writing in relation to this issue;</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div align="left">provide an opportunity to enhance your teaching skills in a teacher-led workshop format; </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div align="left">develop skills at team work and team teaching. </div>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p align="left">Working in teams you will be responsible to immerse yourself in the literature on the teaching of writing in an area chose from the list below. Based on that research, you will develop a presentation and activity for 1/2 of one class period, 1 hr and 40 minutes of instructional 
 time.
        
        <p align="left">This should be a fully and carefully team taught activity where all student  take responsibility for the preparation and teaching.  Dividing the time and each person simply teaching &quot;their&quot; portion  is <em>not</em> team teaching.  You will need to meet often with your team teacher(s) to successfully carry out this activity.
        <p align="left">Your presentation should show that you have absorbed what we have already learned in 4790. Help the class move beyond simplistic, formulaic, or canned methods toward approaches that are informed by theory and research, intellectually and academically meaningful, and connect to the real lives of students.<p align="left">Your presentation / activity should include:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <div align="left">A list of goals for what you want your classmates to learn about this topic. </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div align="left">Between 40-80 pages of high quality, relevant reading assigned to the whole class, carefully selected from a much broader pool of reading you have undertaken. (Make available any needed copying to the professor for  at least 48 hours before needed, and/or use on-line resources.)</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div align="left">A carefully designed lesson that effectively facilitates the learning of other students in the class. There should be more than presentation (show off your skills with <a href="http://prezi.com/">Prezi</a> or <a href="http://edu.glogster.com/">Glogster</a>), but also <em>activity and workshop</em>. Your lesson is targeted to your classmates, future and present teachers, as your audience -- this is <em>not</em> a &quot;mock teach&quot; to pretend secondary students.</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div align="left">Inclusion of the class Ning discussion board.</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div align="left">An assessment of how well your classmates met the learning goals you established. </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div align="left">A 2-page write up of what you learned from this activity and a grade you would propose for your work on this assignment.</div>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p align="left">[Note: As leaders assign reading and discussion questions related to the reading on the Ning (due before class).  Provide me by email with the wording you would like me to post on the Ning for the class discussion. You might email class members to invite and insure their participation. Examining their responses before class may help guide your teaching. I will also be carefully reading responses and recording in my grade book plus, check, minus, or no credit as part of the class participation grade.]</p>
