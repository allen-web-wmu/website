          Working with English as a Second Language Students</font></font></h1>
          <p align="left">According the the <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=96">National Centter on Educational Statistics</a>, 20% of students in American public schools come from families that speak a language other than English at home. This population is rapidly growing and teachers need preparation working with students for whom English is a second language.</p>
          <p align="left">This section of English 4800 includes an email exchange with college students at the University of Braganca, Brazil. These students have learned English as a second language and are preparing to become teachers of English in secondary schools in Brazil. </p>
          <p align="left">The purpose of this exchange is to get to know one or more future English/ESL teachers and learn about common and different backgrounds, interests, and experiences. </p>
          <p align="left">In your exchange of email with this future teacher, you are expected to provide feedback/suggestions for their writing in English. In some measure this will be an opportunity to practice working with and supporting second language learners. </p>
          <p align="left">Ideally, you will exchange at least three emails with one or more ESL students. Write a 1-2 page report on the email exchange, your strategy and thinking about responding to their writing, and what you have learned from the experience. Propose a grade. </p>
          <p align="left">Our class will also include discussion of curriculum addressing classes with large numbers of students of hispanic background (Oct. 2, Principal's hallway virtual school). </p>
