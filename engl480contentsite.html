              <p>Working collaboratively, you will design a content-based, cultural 
                studies website that can serve as a resource for secondary English 
                students and teachers around the world. This site will give you 
                a chance to study literary, library, and internet resources, design 
                effective and relevant curriculum, create teaching and evaluative 
                materials, and reflect on and contribute to the content of secondary 
                literature instruction. While this assignment will create skills 
                and resources for the teaching of the future, it also builds strongly 
                on traditional practice and will prepare you for teaching in non-technological 
                environments as well.</p>
              <p>You will enter your site on the Thinkquest server -- a world 
                famous location for educational content-based websites. This year 
                ten universities have been invited to participate in this collaboration 
                with Thinkquest, including WMU. <a href="http://www.thinkquest.org">Thinkquest 
                </a>is one of the most innovative and academically meaningful 
                internet teaching and learning programs in the world and its sites 
                are visited by thousands of students and teachers everyday. For 
                more information from Thinkquest, here is a <a href="http://www.thinkquest.org/t3/">brief 
                description of the program</a> and <a href="http://t3.thinkquest.org/projectlab/pt3_2001ws_guidelines.html">the 
                complete guidelines and criteria</a> to which Thinkquest would 
                like to see your site aspire. Here are <a href="http://t3.thinkquest.org/writinglab/Webpub.htm">tips 
                on thinkquest sites</a> developed by a professor at Eastern Connecticut 
                University.</p>
              <p align="center"><b>Collaborative Work </b></p>
              <p>Group learning, team teaching, and collegial collaboration are 
                a crucial part of teaching. Facilitating student learning calls 
                for a deep understanding of the group learning process. Thus a 
                primary objective of English 480 is for all of us to develop and 
                practice our collaborative knowledge and skills. Preparing content-based 
                websites will require extensive time and effort including wide 
                reading, library research, internet research, writing,web publishing 
                and web design, group discussion and decision making, and assessment 
                activities. All students are expected to take responsibility for 
                group work while cooperating with others in a professional, mutually 
                respectful, supportive, fair, and critically reflective way. 
              <p align="center"><b>Site Topics</b></p>
              <p>Your group should select one of the following topics. The topics 
                are broad and encompassing; they could compliment many different 
                secondary courses and complete courses could be taught on any 
                one of them. As a grou carefully decide how to limit and focus 
                in order to be most effective. You may want to give your unit 
                a new, more focused title. </p>

              <p align="center"><b>Content Expectations</b></p>
              <p>1. Address literary works. Every unit must extensively address 
                several literary works that could be taught in a secondary English 
                classroom (7-12) as well as whatever other works such as books, 
                essays, articles, videos, websites, etc. that are deemed relevant. 
                Your content-based site must address both young adult literature 
                and literary works from the traditional canon. Feel free to incorporate 
                literature available on-line as well as libraries and traditional 
                course texts.</p>
              <p>2. Utilize a cultural studies approach that helps students understand 
                themselves, the literary works, and literary, cultural, social, 
                political, and historical contexts.</p>
              <p>3. Provide accurate and useful information and resources for 
                students and teachers. Students will appreciate relevant and attractive 
                information, opportunities to express their viewpoints and creativit, 
                as well as intellectually challenging ideas. Teachers will appreciate 
                sample syllabi, study questions, writing prompts, reader-response 
                activities, project ideas, quizes and tests, rubrics, sample letters 
                to parents, etc.</p>
              <p>4. Make the site interactive. Include several webquests and a 
                discussion and/or message board. What other interactive ideas 
                can you come up with?</p>
              <p>5. Address the diverse needs of learners. How would 7th graders 
                and 12th graders approach the site differently? How will you support 
                students who are poor readers as well as those who are academically 
                advanced? How will your site address different learning styles? 
                How will your site be relevant to students from different social, 
                cultural, and geographic backgrounds?</p>
              <p align="center"><b>Class Presentation of Your Site</b></p>
              <p>Your group will have one class period in which to present your 
                site to the rest of the class and orient us to it use. You may 
                assign reading (up to 100 pages) to the class before your presentation. 
                You should request written feedback on your site--this feedback 
                could be given on the class computer conference. Although some 
                formal presentation of the site is acceptable, do devise interactive 
                and involving ways for classmates to learn about and critique 
                your site.</p>

          <p align="center"> <b>Examples</b></p>
          <p> The web is full of learning based sites that can serve as inspiration 
            and sources for ideas. The Thinkquest Award Winning sites made by 
            students of all ages are good model sites focused on student learning. 
            Examine some of these winning sites. I have also collected below some 
            examples of sites already created on the thinkquest server, many that 
            are focused for teachers as well as students. Some are obviously far 
            more sophisticated than others. Looking at several of these sites 
            will be very helpful to get ideas of what you are doing: </p>

          <p align="left">Thinkquest instructions: Ateam can be created, set up, 
            and the proposal submitted by the faculty coach all at one time. The 
            coach will enter the names of the student team members, who do not 
            need to register. We are recommending that a faculty coach select, 
            or have the team select a team leader for each team. The coach would 
            then invite the team leader to register as the second coach on the 
            team. This person would then have the ability to access the team admin 
            page to make any needed changes to the team without involving the 
            faculty coach. The ability to view a team's Web site without needing 
            a password during the development period. The Web sites will not be 
            listed publicly until the faculty coach chooses to do so, so that 
            they will remain essentially private while under development. But 
            the faculty coach, or others the team wishes to review their site 
            can do so without needing to use a password. A password would still 
            be required to upload files or make changes to the sites. </p>
