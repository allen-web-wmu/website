<center>
  <p>At the first class meeting after your group has finished teaching, turn in 
    a self-evaluation as a group leader. </p>
</center>
  <p>This evaluation is not of your whole group's effort but of your individual 
  contribution to that effort. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>1. Print out and complete the <a href="engl480evalf.html">Group-Leader Self-Evaluation 
    form</a>.</p>
  <p> 2. In addition to this form, write a three-page self-evaluation. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the 
      first paragraph of the evaluation to summarize your contributions to the group 
      and propose a grade for yourself for this activity. </li>
    <li>Then spend most of the 
      evaluation, at least two full pages, reflecting on the question: In the future, 
      how could I improve as a group member? Given that it is always easier to change 
      yourself than to change others and that as a teacher you will often be working 
      as a group member with colleagues -- perhaps colleagues similar to your 4800 
      group members -- how can you change <em>your</em> behavor in future to lead to better functioning 
      of the group?</li>
  </ul>
The ability to analyze yourself is important to you as a teacher. Thus, this 
  assignment will also be graded. For example, you might give your self a &quot;B&quot; 
  as a group leader and, if your self-evaluation was well done, you could receive 
  an &quot;A&quot; on the self-evaluation assignment. -- I reserve the right to 
  refuse the grade you propose for yourself as a group leader; if I do not accept 
  your grade, I will discuss it with you.
