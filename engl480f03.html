      This section of English 480 will ground students in traditional approaches 
      to literature pedagogy while simultaneously focusing on recent waves of 
      reform, reader response, cultural studies, and the impact of the internet. 
      For over a generation the reader response movement has generated reform 
      in secondary English teaching. Yet, in confronting a wide range of students, 
      content questions, and social and cultural issues, reader response approaches 
      fall short. Potential answers and new directions for English teaching are 
      beginning to emerge under the umbrella of &quot;cultural studies.&quot; 
      Most recently, dramatic changes in information technology are offering to 
      radically reshape the teaching of literature. The inherited cultural archive 
      is now available on-line in formats and with complementary resources that 
      far exceed what has been available in traditional textbooks. We will examine 
      the legacy of reader response and the potential of cultural studies and 
      internet resources for exploring fundamental questions of why and how to 
      teach literature. 
      <p>We will hold class in a wireless, laptop classroom in Brown Hall specifically 
        designed for English education courses that will allow us to explore a 
        wide variety of new technologies and the classroom format of the future. 
        Our class will be organized by this on-line syllabus that will also serve 
        as an electronic, hyperlinked text book. All students will develop and 
        publish their own teaching website, both a portfolio of work and a real-world 
        working site for future teaching. This electronic portfolio can serve 
        as the basis of the portfolio required during intern teaching. Students 
        will also develop state-of-the-art webquests for their future students. 
        Obtain help for your technology projects at the <a href="http://www.wmich.edu/labs/inst-tech.html">IT 
        Lab</a> in Sangren Hall. 
      <p>A significant portion of the class will be student-led, as we explore 
        the development of response-based, cultural studies literature teaching 
        within the context of NCTE and State of Michigan content standards. Student 
        groups will select topics addressing current and controversial themes 
        such as the mass media, literature and the environment, literature and 
        the Third World (this semester, Africa), literature and religion, literature 
        and sexual orientation, etc. 
      <p>We will have an electronic computer conference that will provide a forum 
        for examination of course goals, content, activity, and methodology as 
        well as serving as a link to web resources. A substantial website focused 
        on <a href="http://www.wmich.edu/teachenglish">Teaching English Through 
        Technology</a> has been developed to support this class and will provide 
        access to streaming videos, on-line resources, and our own server space. 
        <a href="index.html">Dr. Webb's web site</a> (www.allenwebb.net) is an 
        additional resources for aspiring English teachers. You may want to examine 
        the<a href="http://www.wmich.edu/coe/teach_edu/exit.html"> technology 
        outcomes</a> expected of WMU education students. Always bring floppy disks 
        to class so you can retain copies of your work. Before the end of the 
        course, I urge you to burn a copy of your individual and content websites 
        and webquest on to a CD ROM. 
      <p> As the capstone experience for English Education majors, this course 
        entails an exciting variety of professional activities and responsibilities. 
        Students are expected to join the professional organizations, <a href="http://www.ncte.org">NCTE</a> 
        and <a href="http://www.msu.edu/user/mcte/mcte.html">MCTE</a>, and read 
        regularly the <i>English Journal </i>or <i>Voices from the Middle</i>. 
        You are also expected to attend at least one professional teacher conference 
        during the semester. The <a href="http://www.msu.edu/user/mcte/Conferences.htm">MCTE 
        Fall Conference</a> in Lansing will also be held Friday, October 3 (register 
        on-line in advance). The <a href="http://www.ncte.org/convention/2003/index.shtml">NCTE 
        National Conference</a> will be held in San Francisco, Nov. 20-23. Students 
        will present their work at the &quot;Celebration of Teaching English&quot; 
        sponsored by the English education program during the last week of the 
        semester. Information about the Michigan Teacher Certification test is 
        available on the <a href="http://www.mttc.nesinc.com/">MTTC website</a>.
      <p> The final course grade will be an average of grades for the major assignments, 
        listed and weighted below. At the hour scheduled for the final exam students 
        will attend an intern teaching panel. Class participation is vital in 
        480, missing more than 3 classes may lower the grade and missing more 
        than 5 classes may lead to failing. This course will follow WMU policies 
        regarding <a href="honestypolicy.html">academic honesty</a>. This course 
        also supports the <a href="http://www.wmich.edu/wmu/news/1999/9909/9900-060.html">Safe 
        on Campus</a> environment (387-2123); <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0435070053/102-8186383-6519306?v=glance">The

          WMU <a href="http://homepages.wmich.edu/">homepages</a>.</p>
        <p> 2. Think about the role of technology in the future of English teaching. 
          a) View the streaming video and carefully study information on classroom 
          websites on the &quot;Teaching with Technology&quot; page of the <a href="http://www.wmich.edu/teachenglish">Teaching 
          English through Technology</a> website. b) e sure you know what each

        <p>4. Read carefully through the entire on-line syllabus, including all

      <p>Sep. 9/10, T/W: Introduction to <i>English Journal</i> and Teaching Resources</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>1. Read three or more articles from back issues of the <i>English Journal</i> 
          that interest you. You should subscribe to the <a href="http://cc.ysu.edu/tej/"><i>English 
          Journal</i></a> and you can do so from its home website and view the 
          current issue. NCTE members can read back issues of the <i><a href="http://www.ncte.org/ej/">English 
          Journal</a></i> at the NCTE website on-line using their membership number 
          as a password. Back issues are also in the Sangren <a href="http://www.library.wmich.edu/">Library 
          </a>under the call number PE1 .E5. (Between Waldo (all issues before 
          1980) and Sangren (issues after 1980) we have back issues to 1912 when 
          the <i>English Journal</i> began publication--fascinating reading in 
          the history of secondary English teaching!) You can conduct an ERIC 
          search for articles on specific topics by setting &quot;English Journal&quot; 
          as the &quot;source.&quot; </p>
        <p> 2. Examine three or more secondary English lesson plans available 
          on the web. There are many sources for Language Arts lesson plans on 
          the web. Try <a href="http://home.cogeco.ca/%7Erayser3/">Outta Ray's 
          Head</a>, the <a href="http://faldo.atmos.uiuc.edu/CLA/">Collaborative 
          Lesson Archive</a>, NCTE's <a href="http://www.ncte.org/notesplus/">Notes 
          Plus</a>,<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/subjects/languagearts_index.html">New 
          York Times Lesson Plan Archive</a>, <a href="http://www.lessonplanz.com/">Lesson 
          Planz.com</a>, <a href="http://www.sdcoe.k12.ca.us/score/cyberguide.html">Cyberguides</a>,

          </a>, <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/schoolhouse/menus/menulangarts.asp">Encarta</a>, 
          etc. </p>
        <p> 3. Drawing on at least three on-line lesson plans and three <i>English 
          Journal</i> articles, develop an annotated list of &quot;Teaching Ideas&quot; 
          with at least a paragraph of description and comments about how you 
          might use or modify the idea in your own classroom. This will be one 
          page for the teacher resources section of your website, bring to class 
          on a floppy disk.</p>
        <p>4. Hold a group meeting at a prearranged time using a live chat, such 
          as <a href="http://www.aol.com">AOL Instant Messenger</a> or <a href="http://messenger.msn.com/default.asp?client=1">MSN 
          Messenger</a>.</p>

          the &quot;middle school philosophy&quot; on a host of the key issues.) 
          Taken together, these 20 research papers comprise the &quot;middle school 
          philosophy&quot; (as opposed to the &quot;Junior High&quot; philosophy). 
          Be sure you can compare and contrast the middle school philosophy with
