          Literature in the Secondary Schools</strong></font> </p>
        
        <p align="center"><p align="left">In an effort to prepare future secondary English teachers for the students and classrooms of the 21st Century, this section of English 4800 will focus on a justice, inquiry, and action approach. In so doing we will address the Common Core Standards, changing student populations, and reform movements in the the teaching of literature including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reader-response_criticism" target="_blank">reader response</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_literacy" target="_blank">digital literacy</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_pedagogy" target="_blank">critical pedagogy</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_studies" target="_blank">cultural studies</a>. </p>
        <p align="left">(In this course the term "critical inquiry" is in the tradition of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory" target="_blank">critical theory</a>," not the more abstracted, decontextualized, and superficial approach of "<a href="https://www.rasmussen.edu/student-experience/college-life/critical-thinking-skills-to-master-now/" target="_blank">critical thinking skills</a>." Likewise, the term "<a href="https://www.sac.edu/AcademicAffairs/TracDat/Pages/Inquiry-Based-Learning-.aspx" target="_blank">inquiry</a>" is richer than the simpler, but also of value, expression "<a href="http://beyondpenguins.ehe.osu.edu/issue/energy-and-the-polar-environment/questioning-techniques-research-based-strategies-for-teachers" target="_blank">questioning strategies</a>.")</p>
        <p align="left">
        <p align="left">After the first part of the semester directed by the instructor, students will take significant responsiblity for course, choosing the reading, creating assignments and activities, and assessing learning 
          as we explore critical inquiry approaches to developing meaningful curriculum and instruction in contemporary secondary schools. 
          This approach represents an experiment in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulo_Freire" target="_blank">Frierian</a> teacher-student, student-teacher education. </p>
        <p align="left">
        <p align="left">In an era of anti-democratic governmentality, <a href="https://educatorvoices.wordpress.com/2013/05/22/what-have-schools-got-to-do-with-neo-liberalism/" target="_blank">neo-liberal educational reform</a>, standardized testing, the corporatization of curriculum, and attacks on "critical race theory" and teacher freedom, future teachers need to think critically about established curriculum regimes and consider how to develop the freedom they need to prepare their students as global citizens in an unfinished, indeed endangered, democracy threatened by demogoguery, inequality, and global warming. </p>
        <p align="left">
        <p align="center">Justice, Inquiry, and Action</p>
        <p align="left">The starting point  for a critical inquiry, social justice approach to teaching literature is engaging with critical issues in the world and in the lives of adolescents via relevant and meaningful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thematic_learning" target="_blank">thematic curriculum</a>. In dialogue with student questions and interest, English language arts teachers should be able to  bring together a wide  range of cultural materials, including traditional works, multicultural and young adult literature, visual and media texts including film, and cultural and informational texts, and address <em>what</em> texts mean, as well as <em>how</em> they mean, in historical, cultural, political, and social contexts. </p>
        <p align="left">In English 4800 teachers are considered to be <em>transformative intellectuals</em>, producers rather than transmitters of knowledge. More than simply being a <em>reflective</em> pracitioner who can rethink teaching practices in order to improve them, this course also aims to prepare you to be a <em>critical</em> practitioner, a teacher who leads inquiry into social, cultural, and ideological issues, and finds ways to support students acting upon what they learn.</p>
<p align="left">
<p align="left">Thematic teaching facilitates teaching that addresses different abilities, learning styles, and backgrounds. English as a second language students now consitute <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cgf.asp" target="_blank">9% of the school population</a> in the United States, and their numbers continue to  increase. This class will focus on developing curriculum that will foster the engagement and success of all students. </p>
        
        <p align="left">By examining relevant, challenging, and potentially controversial topics for justice, inquiry, and action teaching during the student-led portion of the course, future teachers will gain understanding of  approaches, strategies, curriculum, and issues involved in teaching literature at the secondary level, see <a href="engl480goals.html" target="_blank">Course Goals</a>. 
          (You may also want to review the WMU teacher education <a href="https://wmich.edu/education/about/mission" target="_blank">Mission</a>.) </p>

        <p align="left">Student groups will select topics addressing current and 
          controversial areas to inquire into such as: </p>

<p align="center">New Literacies and New Technologies               
        <p align="left">Rapid evolution  in information technology offers many avenues and resources for critical inquiry extending and reshaping the teaching of English. The inherited cultural 
          archive is now available in digital format  on-line. Complementary  resources and tools
        that far exceed what is  in  textbooks are now available on the Internet and new genres of informational and visual texts are emerging. Artificial intelligence is emerging with programs like <a href="https://chat.openai.com/auth/login" target+"_blank">ChatGBT</a> revolutionizing writing and the teaching of writing.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
               <p align="left">The WMU English Department has, perhaps, <a href="http://brn227.brown.wmich.edu/eelab" target="_blank">the most advanced language arts teacher preparation classrooms in the world</a>. Rather than training teachers to adopt cook book software or corporate &quot;classroom management&quot; packages, these labs foster teacher designed instruction, critical thinking about technology and curriculum, teacher and student publication, free, open-source, or low cost resources, and strategies for bringing the vast resources and communicative possibilities of the Internet to all students.

          <p>Since the class is  discussion-based, attendance and preparation are essential  to your own  learning and to the learning of your classmates. Missing          any classes will affect your learning. Missing more 3 classes may lower your grade and missing 5 classes may lead        to failing. Study my philosophy regarding <a href="attendancephilosophy.html" target="_blank">discussion, preparation, participation, attendance, grading, and learning</a> -- and consider your own philosophy!</p>
          <p>Your final course grade will be an average of grades for the major assignments,

    </blockquote>

 	  
      <p>Sep 20: <strong><em>English Journal</em>, Online Lesson Plans, &amp; Student-led Unit Planning </strong></p>
<blockquote>
   <p>1. Carefully read three or more articles from back issues of the <em>English Journal</em> that connect to your topic for the unit you will lead. Take notes you can share in class. 
	   
	   <br><br>You can subscribe to the <a href="https://store.ncte.org/journals/english-journal#_=_" target="_blank"><em>English 
	          Journal</em></a> (member price $25). NCTE members can read back issues of the <em><a href="http://www.ncte.org/journals/ej/issues" target="_blank">English 
	            Journal</a></em> at the NCTE website on-line using their membership number 
	          as a password. To find articles connected to the unit you are going to lead&nbsp; will want to conduct an ERIC 
	          search (via our <a href="http://libguides.wmich.edu/content.php?pid=209545&sid=1745865" target="_blank">library database access</a>). 
	   
	   <br><br>For articles on specific topics, for example for the unit you will be leading, <strong>first</strong> set &quot;English Journal&quot; as the &quot;SO Journal Title&quot; Field. (Use quotation marks around "English Journal" - even with quotation marks on "English Journal" you may still get journals like "Arab World English Journal," which you can ignore. Look out: without the quotation marks many different journals will come up.) <strong>Second</strong>, for another Field use descriptive terms for your topic (try different key word variations relevant to the topic). (You will get the most articles if for your topic you use the field "TX All Text" which searches the full text of articles, not just titles or descriptors. Title and descriptor searches can be good if you are getting <em>too many</em> articles). </p>
<p> 2. Find three or more secondary English lesson plans available on 
          the web that you consider to be thoughtful and well-crafted and that connect to your topic for the unit you will lead. Take notes you can share in class. 
	     <br><br>There are many sources for Language Arts lesson plans on the web. Try <a href="http://readwritethink.org/" target="_blank">Read/Write/Think</a>, <a href="http://www.rayser.ca/" target="_blank">Outta

	</blockquote>
<p>Sep 25:<strong> Leading Discussion</strong></p>
<blockquote>
	<p>1: Read: "Teaching Toward Great Conversations" by Randy Bomer and make a list of 10 things a teacher can do to improve conversations and discussions.</p>
	<p>2: Study: <a href="discussion.html" target="_blank">Creating Discussion Questions</a>, as well as <a href="disanalysis.html" target="_blank">A System for Analyzing Discussion</a>.
