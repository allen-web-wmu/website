            Take Home Final Essay</font></font></h1>
          <p align="left">This final assignment provides an opportunity 
            to reflect back on and to demonstrate what you have learned in English 4800 by analyzing and comparing what we have learned in our class with observations of the real world, 
            with books that could have been used as texts for the class, or with 
            syllabi of similar courses at other universities. Choose ONE of the 
            options below. Be careful to draw on and refer to the specific learning 
            that took place in our class as you write the final essay, including traditional 
            methods, reader response approaches, cultural studies, and new technologies. 
            (Minimum 5 pages)</p>
          <p align="left"><b>Option 1: Classroom Visit</b> </p>
        </center>
        <p align="left"> Visit a secondary literature or language arts classroom 
          and observe one class period on at least two different days or two different 
          class periods on the same day. Interview the teacher asking questions 
          about his or her approach to teaching literature, curriculum, discussion 
          leading, activities, etc. 
        <p align="left"> For your essay, describe the class, students, and curriculum. 
          Drawing on what you have learned in 4800, what seem to be the strength's 
          and weaknesses of the teacher's approach? If you were this teacher's 
          intern how would you proceed? Include any data collected. 
        <p align="left"> Through your classroom visits, interview, and write up, 
          demonstrate a high level of professional conduct, awareness of the complexity 
          of the teaching process, and respect for the expertise and confidentiality 
          of the teacher your observe. <br>
          <br>
          <b>Option 2: English Teaching Textbook</b>
        <p align="left"> Drawing on what you have learned in English 4800, read 
          and analyze a book that could have been used as a textbook for our class. 
          To further acquaint yourself with the professional literature in English 
          education, choose a book new to you, one you have not read for another 
          class. Some of these books have been ordered as optional texts for 4800 
          (see those in blue) and all can be ordered on-line.. These books can 
          also be found for free in Sangren library. Suggested titles:
