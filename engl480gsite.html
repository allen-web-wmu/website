            Web Site</font></b></font></p>
          <p align="left">In the Group Web Site assignment your student-led group 
            will not only be researching, designing, and presenting to your classmates 
            cutting-edge teaching approaches, but you will be designing an interactive 
            web site to bring these same teaching approaches to other preservice 
            and inservice teachers around the world.</p>
          <p align="left"> As you research your topic and consider ways to impact 
            the future teaching of your classmates, the group web site also asks 
            you to consider how you can impact the teaching of the entire teaching 
            profession. The question foremost in your mind as you design your 
            group site ought to be: How can we help other teachers learn about 
            and come to integrate the approach that we advocate? You may find 
            that involving one or more currently practicing teachers in the development 
            of your site may give you valuable feedback and ideas. You will want 
            to think about the style of learning and the interactive possibilities 
            that the internet makes possible and incorporate them into your site. 
            The goal is to create a site that will help preservice and practicing 
            teachers everywhere learn how to integrate your topic into their curriculum. 
            Feel free to focus the site for teachers in your chosen content area 
            and grade level.</p>
          <p align="left">You will enter your site on the Thinkquest server -- 
            a world famous location for educational content-based websites. This 
            year ten universities have been invited to participate in this collaboration 
            with Thinkquest, including WMU. <a href="http://www.thinkquest.org">Thinkquest 
            </a>is one of the most innovative and academically meaningful internet 
            teaching and learning programs in the world and its sites are visited 
            by thousands of students and teachers everyday. For more information 
            from Thinkquest, here is a <a href="http://www.thinkquest.org/t3/">brief 
            description of the program</a> and <a href="http://t3.thinkquest.org/projectlab/pt3_2001ws_guidelines.html">the

          <p align="left"> 1. EXAMPLES: Here are some examples of group teaching 
            sites already created on the thinkquest server. I have selected sites 
            that I think you will find interesting as examples. Some are obviously 
            far more sophisticated than others. Looking at several of these sites 
            will be very helpful to get ideas of what you are doing: </p>

          <p align="left">2. GETTING STARTED The proceedures will be finalized 
            by Sept. 7. Here is what we know at present:<br>
            A team can be created, set up, and the proposal submitted by the faculty 
            coach all at one time. The coach will enter the names of the student 
            team members, who do not need to register. We are recommending that 
            a faculty coach select, or have the team select a team leader for 
            each team. The coach would then invite the team leader to register 
            as the second coach on the team. This person would then have the ability 
            to access the team admin page to make any needed changes to the team 
            without involving the faculty coach. The ability to view a team's 
            Web site without needing a password during the development period. 
            The Web sites will not be listed publicly until the faculty coach 
            chooses to do so, so that they will remain essentially private while 
            under development. But the faculty coach, or others the team wishes 
            to review their site can do so without needing to use a password. 
            A password would still be required to upload files or make changes 
            to the sites. We expect to have these changes finalized and tested 
            and ThinkQuest pre service ready for coaches to sign up their teams 
            and get Web accounts by September 7th. Please do not have teams register 
            for TQ pre service until we have made the change and sent the new 
          </p>
          <p align="left">3. ACTUALLY MAKING IT WORK: Thinkquest has provided 
            a "resource center" with helpful supporting information. Their <a href="http://www.thinkquest.org/resources/index.html">resource 
            list page</a>; the key link on this page is probably the "Uploading 
            Tutorial." They also have a help desk that can answer questions. The 
            WMU IT Lab in Sangren Hall can give individual students help.</p>
          <p align="left">This group teaching site is intended to develop the 
            internet literacy and web-publishing skills of all students. Dreamweaver 
            is available on all campus lab computers and for free 30 day trial 
            down load. You can also use Netscape Composer which is free on all 
            machines with Netscape.<br>
