<p>CASE STUDY </p>
<p><strong>Joyce Davidson </strong></p>
<p>A high school English teacher is not making much progress with a <br />
  remedial English class and is particularly concerned about an <br />
  extremely shy student. <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Joyce Davidson gazed unhappily at the folder of papers on the table in front <br />
  of her and then raised her head to scan the study hall she was monitoring. <br />
  Students were whispering quietly or working. Joyce knew that she should <br />
  concentrate on grading the papers she had brought, but the next period <br />
  was her ninth-period remedial English class, and she often used this study <br />
  hall just to regroup mentally and try to find the reserves of energy she would <br />
  need to manage the class. &ldquo;This just wasn&rsquo;t such a problem last year,&rdquo; Joyce <br />
  thought ruefully. &ldquo;Maybe Beth&rsquo;s lack of participation is getting to me.&rdquo; </p>
<p>This was Joyce&rsquo;s second year teaching in the English department at <br />
  Littleton High School. Joyce enjoyed her job partly because it was demanding,<br />
  but dealing with this particular English class for ninth-and tenth-<br />
  graders was a special challenge. The class was loud and boisterous and tough <br />
  to control, except for one quiet little girl. Beth Martin had been in the <br />
  same class with Joyce last year, as had six others of her thirteen students, <br />
  but this year the child seemed increasingly withdrawn and indifferent. Joyce <br />
  herself was an outgoing, gregarious person, and a withdrawn child caused <br />
  her concern. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for one thing,&rdquo; Joyce thought, &ldquo;last year I had this class first <br />
  period. Ninth period is the worst time of day for everyone.&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t so <br />
  much that Beth was tired or difficult at the end of the day; it was that the <br />
  rest of the class was so much louder and intimidating. &ldquo;At 7:45 in the <br />
  morning they&rsquo;ve hardly woken up,&rdquo; Joyce thought with a smile. </p>
<p>Beth was a short blond girl of 16. She had a slow gait and a timid <br />
  manner; she entered the classroom every afternoon with her books held <br />
  tight to her chest as if it were the first day of class. All the students in Joyce&rsquo;s <br />
  class were reading well below grade level, but Beth seemed to have the most <br />
  difficulty. Most of the rest of the class exhibited more behavior problems <br />
  than academic ones. Beth&rsquo;s file reported a slight speech delay, which Joyce <br />
  thought was a considerable understatement, since Beth almost never spoke <br />
  in Joyce&rsquo;s class. Beth was not an independent thinker and worked best on <br />
  worksheets or with rote material. Her reading grade level was about 4.5, <br />
  and her written work matched her reading level. </p>
<p>Joyce thought that Beth was immature in her outside activities as well <br />
  and that this contributed to her isolation. Beth seemed to be overprotected <br />
by her parents. Joyce&rsquo;s mental image of Beth being picked up at the bus<br />
stop by her mother, going home, having a snack, and watching cartoons <br />
  crystalized for her the challenge of getting this 16-year-old girl to interact <br />
with a class full of loud and rambunctious teenagers in order to learn. </p>
<p>Last year, Joyce had wondered whether assignment to a special education <br />
  class might serve Beth better than the remedial track she was now in. She <br />
  had inquired about Beth&rsquo;s placement and learned that Beth had been <br />
  evaluated in middle school and that the test results indicated that she was <br />
  not eligible for special services. Joyce agreed in principle with the concept <br />
  of regular classroom instruction whenever possible, and she had vowed to <br />
  make Beth&rsquo;s time in her class productive. </p>
<p>There were four levels of classes in most academic subjects at Littleton <br />
  High, which the administration tried not to refer to as &ldquo;tracks.&rdquo; Joyce&rsquo;s <br />
  ninth-period English class was a remedial class. Most of the students in it <br />
  were in remedial classes all day except for art, music, and gym, which were <br />
  not grouped by ability. Joyce&rsquo;s class this year was also larger than the one <br />
  in which Beth had been placed last year: Last year Joyce had had only ten <br />
  students in the sophomore remedial English class. She knew that had been <br />
  a real luxury; in fact, she was lucky to have only thirteen students this year. <br />
  The class was made up of eleven boys and two girls; the other girl was as <br />
  flamboyant and aggressive as Beth was reserved. Angela was Peruvian and, <br />
  at 17, was one of the oldest students in the class. She had confided to Joyce <br />
  that when she first arrived in the United States four years ago, she had been <br />
  as quiet and shy as Beth, a claim Joyce thought preposterous. Angela was <br />
  Beth&rsquo;s antithesis. </p>

  <br />
  <br />
  The boys in the class were an engaging mixture of personalities: enthusi-<br />
  astic, friendly, loud, and occasionally hyperactive. There was one other shy <br />
  student in the class, but his reserve was very different from Beth&rsquo;s. Rao, who <br />
  was West Indian, was intellectually alert and conscientious; his assignment <br />
  to Joyce&rsquo;s class was the result of difficulty with English as a second language. <br />
  Rao&rsquo;s withdrawal was probably due to fear of being drawn into misbehavior <br />
by his peers; Beth&rsquo;s isolation seemed to be the result of indifference. </p>
<p>The boys in Joyce&rsquo;s class were black or Hispanic. All were sophisticated <br />
  and worldly; their poor reading skills had not prevented them from becoming <br />
  social creatures who participated actively in life outside the school. This <br />
  participation was not all positive: Pedro, for example, was fond of flashing <br />
  wads of bills. </p>
<p>Joyce worked hard to ensure that her students were comfortable in her <br />
  class so that they could participate freely. While the price of this atmosphere <br />
  was an occasional behavior problem, Joyce felt that it was crucial to establish <br />
  a positive, risk-free climate if her students were to learn. </p>
<p>Joyce actually jumped when the bell rang signaling the end of the eighth <br />
  period, and she thought once again what an irritating sound it was. She sighed <br />
  as she stuffed her unopened folders into her book bag and headed toward <br />
  ninth-period English. &ldquo;Still all questions and no answers,&rdquo; she thought. </p>
<p>Joyce opened the solid, heavy door to the small classroom and immediately <br />
  saw Beth sitting at a desk. Beth was always the first to arrive. &ldquo;Hi, Beth,&rdquo; <br />
Joyce said with a smile. &ldquo;How was your weekend?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Beth did not answer, at least not audibly, and Joyce quickly began setting <br />
  out materials for the day&rsquo;s lesson. Not having a room permanently assigned <br />
  made teaching much more difficult. Joyce could not decorate, post students&rsquo; <br />
  work, or otherwise personalize the classroom. The L-shaped room was longer <br />
  than it was wide, making seating difficult, and it seemed crowded even <br />
  though furnished with only fifteen desks. By ninth period, the desks were <br />
  awry, the wastebaskets were full, and the air was thick with the smell of <br />
  lunch recently served in the cafeteria next door. </p>
<p>For weeks, Joyce&rsquo;s class had been working on nouns and adjectives: <br />
  What are they? How are they identified? How are they used? Joyce was <br />
  permitted some latitude in course content, and she tried to choose reading <br />
  and writing activities over grammar whenever she could. But at least two-<br />
  thirds of the sophomore curriculum was mandated, and parts of speech <br />
  were unavoidable. Joyce was having trouble getting her students to focus <br />
  on these lessons, and she found it difficult to make the material interesting <br />
  and meaningful. </p>
<p>Today, Joyce planned to review the subject again and then group the <br />
  students for an exercise designed to give them practice in what they had <br />
  been learning. As usual, she had tried to design a lesson that would hold <br />
  her students&rsquo; attention in spite of their distractibility and boisterousness. </p>
<p>&ldquo;OK, settle down and listen up,&rdquo; Joyce said loudly enough to be heard <br />
  as soon as the bell rang and the last student let the door slam behind him. <br />
&ldquo;I know everyone had a good weekend, but it&rsquo;s time to get to work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo, Miss D, what are those magazines for?&rdquo; called a tall boy who lounged <br />
  comfortably at a desk by the window. </p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re for you, Tyrone, and your teammate, after you come up here <br />
  to the board and help me out,&rdquo; replied Joyce with a big smile. General <br />
  laughter greeted Joyce&rsquo;s invitation to Tyrone, as he groaned and affected <br />
  great reluctance. In fact, it was no easy matter for him to pull his long, <br />
  powerful legs from beneath the desk to come to the board. </p>
<p>When Tyrone was beside her, Joyce handed him the dry erase marker and said, <br />
  &ldquo;Write an example of a noun, Tyrone.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Tyrone took the dry erase marker and turned to look at Joyce. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of no <br />
  noun.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you can, nouns are everywhere.&rdquo; Joyce gestured widely with her <br />
  arm. </p>
<p>Tyrone&rsquo;s eyes followed Joyce&rsquo;s gesture, and then they lit up as an idea <br />
  occurred to him. Joyce just loved seeing that look on her students&rsquo; faces. <br />
  Tyrone turned to the board and wrote the word air with a flourish. Looking <br />
  pleased with himself, he pivoted to return to his seat. &ldquo;Wait, Tyrone. That&rsquo;s <br />
  fine,&rdquo; said Joyce, and she put out a hand to keep him with her. He rolled <br />
  his eyes good-naturedly. Joyce knew he loved the spotlight. She turned her <br />
  attention to the class. &ldquo;Air&mdash;that&rsquo;s a noun, right? Luis, tell Tyrone a sentence <br />
  to write using this noun.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Luis&rsquo;s desk was at the back of the classroom, and he was leaning back <br />
  in his chair, pulling at a cord on the wall near the window. <br />
  He pulled it and let it snap back a few times as he thought. &ldquo;Tyrone is a <br />
  air head,&rdquo; he finally said solemnly. The class erupted in laughter, and Tyrone <br />
  threw the marker in Luis&rsquo;s direction as he, too, laughed. </p>
<p>Joyce was smiling even as she tried not to laugh. She mentally rehearsed <br />
  the sentence in her head and contemplated a response. She realized that <br />
  Luis had stumbled upon one of the few possible usages of the word air as <br />
  an adjective, and she could not resist the urge to use his contribution <br />
  positively. Joyce knew she risked fanning the fire with these students, since <br />
  insults were the &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; of their constant confrontations, but she couldn&rsquo;t <br />
  let the opportunity pass. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Write it,&rdquo; she said to Tyrone, gesturing toward the board and handing <br />
  him a new marker. </p>
<p>&ldquo;No way,&rdquo; Tyrone laughed, and he refused the marker. Joyce was laughing <br />
  with her students as she went to the board herself and wrote &ldquo;Mr. X is an&rdquo; <br />
  and &ldquo;head&rdquo; around the word air, which Tyrone had already supplied. As <br />
  Joyce turned to the class, the students were still laughing. Joyce held up <br />
  her hand and waited, indicating to Tyrone with her eyes that he could <br />
  return to his seat. In a minute the class quieted down enough for her to <br />
  be heard. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Air in this sentence is not a noun, Luis,&rdquo; Joyce said matter of factly. <br />
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luis looked at Joyce blankly. Joyce persisted. &ldquo;Luis, how is the word air <br />
  used in your sentence?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Luis looked around, as if trying to find the answer on the walls or the <br />
  ceiling, and Joyce waited. Slowing herself down had been one of her biggest <br />
  challenges in this job, but she had learned. Only when Luis reached for <br />
  the  cord again did Joyce help him out. &ldquo;Luis, look at the board.&rdquo; <br />
  When he was looking up, she continued. &ldquo;Everyone look at the board. Is <br />
  air what the sentence is talking about? Luis, what is the sentence talking <br />
  about?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. X,&rdquo; Luis replied slowly. He and the other students were following <br />
  Joyce now. Joyce saw that Beth was looking in her direction also, and Joyce <br />
  thought about calling on her. But it was unlikely that Beth would respond, <br />
  and these moments came too rarely with this class to break her momentum <br />
  now. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; Joyce exclaimed. &ldquo;Mr. X is one noun in the sentence. We know <br />
  it&rsquo;s a noun because it&rsquo;s the name of someone.&rdquo; Joyce underlined Mr. X and <br />
  continued. &ldquo;What else is the sentence talking about? What other word is a <br />
  noun? Angela?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Head!&rdquo; Angela shouted. The class laughed at Angela&rsquo;s style as much <br />
  as at her answer, and Joyce waited again. </p>
<p>&ldquo;OK,&rdquo; Joyce said when she could be heard. &ldquo;You are right. Head is a <br />
  noun because it is the name of something. Now, listen, here it comes. What <br />
  kind of head? David. What kind of head?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Air head!&rdquo; David answered. <br />
  &ldquo;Right. Luis, what is the word air in this sentence? It tells us what kind <br />
  of head we are talking about. How is the word air used in the sentence?&rdquo; <br />
  Luis was really concentrating as he looked at the sentence. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an <br />
  adjective!&rdquo; he said. The class was looking at the board with him. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; Joyce smiled. She sat on the corner of the teacher&rsquo;s desk and <br />
  let her shoulders drop a little. Her relaxation seemed to touch the class. <br />
  As the students sat back in their chairs, she repeated Luis&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;Air is <br />
  an adjective in this sentence, not a noun. We are not talking about air in <br />
  this sentence. Air tells us about the word after it. Air describes the next <br />
  word; it modifies the next word. Air is an adjective here. Usually, in most <br />
  sentences, air is a noun, but in the sentence Luis made up, air is an adjective.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Joyce got up and went to the board. She erased the sentence and wrote <br />
  &ldquo;Beth flies through the air.&rdquo; &ldquo;Beth, where is a noun in this sentence? Beth?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Beth was looking at Joyce, and Joyce made eye contact, but she was not <br />
  sure the girl had heard her. Tyrone called out from the rear, &ldquo;Beth is a <br />
  noun.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to hear from Beth,&rdquo; Joyce said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give each other time to <br />
  answer. Beth, Tyrone was right. The word Beth in this sentence is a noun&mdash; <br />
  a proper noun because it is a person&rsquo;s name. What is another noun in this <br />
sentence?&rdquo; Joyce leaned a little toward Beth as she held her left hand under<br />
the sentence on the board. This time the class waited, although as the <br />
  seconds passed, the inevitable whispering, shuffling, and laughing began. <br />
Finally Beth softly said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t fly.&rdquo; </p>
<p>As her class broke into new peals of laughter, Joyce glanced at the clock. <br />
  By now she was running short on time. The class&rsquo;s earlier laughter had <br />
  been for a good cause, but it was time-consuming. Joyce knew that Beth <br />
  was not trying to be obtuse, but she was slowing the class down. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet down,&rdquo; Joyce admonished. She took a deep breath. &ldquo;Beth, pretend <br />
  you can fly. Think about the sentence here on the board. Your name, <br />
  the word Beth [Joyce underlined the word Beth as she spoke], is one noun <br />
in this sentence. What other word in the sentence is a noun?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Beth looked a long time at the board. Noises from outside the room <br />
  filtered in. (The school dismissed some students early to catch buses, and <br />
  the bus stop was right outside the classroom windows.) Joyce prayed she <br />
  wouldn&rsquo;t have to wait so long that the rest of the class would start throwing <br />
  things at the kids outside. </p>
<p>Finally Beth spoke, so softly that Joyce had to read her lips to hear her. <br />
  &ldquo;Air?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Louder, Beth. Say it so that the class can hear you.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Air?&rdquo; Beth repeated, still hesitatingly. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Right! Air! Air is a noun in this sentence. It was an adjective in the <br />
  sentence before.&rdquo; Joyce scanned the class to look for expressions of <br />
  comprehension or confusion. &ldquo;Do you all understand?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Sure enough, the delay in waiting for Beth to answer had broken the <br />
  other students&rsquo; train of thought. Joyce saw a few quizzical looks and a few <br />
  expressions of understanding, but the rest of her class had forgotten the <br />
  topic. Joyce felt frustrated: Learning had been happening a moment before, <br />
  but now she had lost the students. Joyce seldom proceeded without ensuring <br />
  complete understanding, but she had to move on if she was to get her next <br />
  activity done. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we are going to pair off. I want each of you to work with one <br />
  other person. We have a project to do about nouns and adjectives.&rdquo; Joyce <br />
  began to pair students sitting next to one another. &ldquo;Angela, you work with <br />
  Pedro. Beth, you work with Tyrone. Luis . . .&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo; wanna work with her,&rdquo; Tyrone interrupted. </p>
<p>Joyce used grouping often in her class, and she usually allowed students <br />
  to work with whomever they chose, especially when they were working in <br />
  pairs. Most of the time the students were fairly tolerant of Beth, seeming <br />
  to recognize her differences, but they did not socialize with her and seldom <br />
  wanted to work with her. Joyce did not tolerate rudeness, but Beth was often <br />
  so blank and indifferent that Joyce thought simple remarks like Tyrone&rsquo;s <br />
  went right over her head. In any event, Joyce elected not to challenge <br />
  Tyrone. &ldquo;You may work with whomever you want.&rdquo; Tyrone happily rose and <br />
  walked over to Luis. Their earlier exchange had apparently made them fast <br />
  friends. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Bartino, will you please work with Beth?&rdquo; Joyce indicated Tyrone&rsquo;s <br />
  vacant seat for her assistant, who had been watching quietly from the back <br />
  of the room. Joyce often used Anita Bartino to work individually with Beth, <br />
  anyway. When they were working in pairs, Joyce needed Anita to round out <br />
  the number, and Beth certainly needed the extra attention. </p>
<p>Joyce got all the students teamed and explained their assignment. They <br />
  were to search for examples of nouns or adjectives in the magazines she <br />
  had brought and were to cut them out and paste them onto construction <br />
  paper in an appropriate arrangement or design. Joyce gave the students <br />
  some examples, showing them how they could choose just nouns, just 
  adjectives, <br />
  or nouns and adjectives all on a certain theme (all about fashion, for <br />
  instance). She told them that supplies&mdash;scissors, glue, markers, crayons&mdash; <br />
  were available at the center of the room on a supply table. Joyce usually <br />
  orchestrated projects in this way so that the entire class was required to <br />
  cooperate in order for individual teams to obtain materials. </p>
<p>The students were more or less occupied with their task as Joyce walked <br />
  from pair to pair. She worked for a time with Tyrone and Luis, and then <br />
  she turned and saw Beth sitting alone, looking quietly at the magazine on <br />
  her desk. Anita had partially turned her chair away from Beth and was <br />
  answering a question for another group. </p>
<p>Joyce approached the girl and spoke softly. &ldquo;Beth, do you need something?&rdquo; <br />
  Beth looked at Joyce without much expression. &ldquo;Scissors,&rdquo; she answered <br />
  softly. <br />
  &ldquo;You know we have to share materials in this class, Beth,&rdquo; Joyce said. <br />
  Beth did not reply. &ldquo;How do you get supplies that you need?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask?&rdquo; Beth asked quietly. </p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Beth,&rdquo; Joyce replied. &ldquo;Ask the other kids for what you <br />
  need. We have to share.&rdquo; <br />
  Beth looked doubtfully at Joyce and then spoke in the general direction <br />
  of the rest of the class. &ldquo;Can I have the scissors, please?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Louder, Beth&rdquo; persisted Joyce. &ldquo;You have to speak up to get what you <br />
  want in this class.&rdquo; Anita turned away from the other group and began to <br />
  move her chair toward Beth, but Joyce stopped her with a glance. Beth <br />
  remained mute. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Beth, this is a loud, noisy class. You have to talk loud enough for the <br />
  others to hear you and ask them for what you need. Just ask again so that <br />
  they can hear you.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Finally Beth repeated the phrase. &ldquo;Can I have the scissors?&rdquo; Her voice <br />
  was still soft, but Pedro, her nearest neighbor, heard her. He handed a pair <br />
  of scissors back to Beth without turning around. </p>

  and dismiss the class. She was really worried about Beth. Joyce thought her <br />
  approach and personal style were beginning to work for the rest of the <br />
  students, and she did not want to jeopardize their progress. But after a year <br />
  and a quarter she still had not found the combination that would unlock <br />
Beth&rsquo;s mind and bring her into the group.<br />
