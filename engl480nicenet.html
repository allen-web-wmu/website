          Conference</font></font></h1>
        <p align="left">Our computer conference, hosted at <a href="http://www.nicenet.org">Nicenet.org</a>, will add a rich threaded discussion forum to our course.
        Notice that this is a free, educational site that can be also be used with   middle school and high school students. 
        <p align="left">Your entries should be thoughtful and respond to the ideas 
          of other students. Reading student entries is as important as entering 
          your own responses. 
        <p align="left">The idea is not just to respond once to a topic and then move on, never to return. The idea is to read carefully other posts, respond, go to other items, return to the earlier item the next day or a couple of days later on, respond to new posts, look for new items, return to the first item again, respond again, and so on. In this way rich, interactive discussion develops, and a conversation started near the beginning of the class might grow and grow over the course of the whole semester.
        <p align="left">It is important to start early and keep up with the conference. 
          Use professional manners, while being informal at the same time. Don't 
          &quot;flame&quot; other people's responses -- it is often a good idea 
          to reread an entire item before reacting too quickly to an upsetting 
          comment from another student. You can <a href="engl480nicenetweblinks.html">post live links in your Nicenet messages</a>.</p>
        <p align="left">For fall and spring semesters aim to enter 3-4 posts per week during the professor directed portion of the class to earn an &quot;A&quot; on this  component 
          of class participation. (For summer semester 6-8 posts per week.) Previous experience indicates 
          this requires a regular time commitment of at least 30 mins per week, 
          or twice that in summer.</p>
        <p align="left">I recommend: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <div align="left">post at least one message that is at least 100 words, or more for every class meeting</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div align="left">write at least 2 additional replys directly to other people's posts</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div align="left">write messages that engage in a &quot;discussion&quot;</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div align="left">post your first messages as soon as you can, certainly at least  24 hours before class</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div align="left">visit more than once so you can see (and write messages or reply) to what others have written</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div align="left">after a given class meeting that the item refers to the topic is not &quot;dead&quot; --  you are encouraged to return and continue the discussion after class has met</div>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p align="left">During student-led units participation expectations will be set by group leaders.</p>
        <p align="left">On-line discussions can take a great variety of forms, be put to many purposes, and be held to different standards. There are a variety of tools beyond Nicenet for these forums, including built-in programs in (for profit) Blackboard/WebCT, Desire2Learn, and (open source)] <a href="https://moodle.org/">Moodle</a>. Every Wikipage has an associated built-in discussion page that can be used for class discussion -- wikis are great tools for collaborative learning and teaching! </p>
        <p align="left">A full explanation of how to integrate on-line discussion, particularly Nicenet, into literature teaching is available in chapter two of my book <em><a href="http://books.heinemann.com/products/E02147.aspx">Literature and the Web:</a> Reading and Responding with New Technologies</em>.        </p>
