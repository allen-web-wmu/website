          Literature in the Secondary Schools</strong></font>
        <p align="left">This section of English 4800 will ground students in traditional 
          approaches to literature pedagogy while simultaneously focusing on recent 
          waves of reform, reader response, cultural studies, and the impact of 
          the internet. We will use a thematic approach to integrate these approaches 
          as we explore a variety of cultural studies themes in a problem-posing, 
          student-led format. 
        <p align="left">For over a generation the reader response movement has generated 
          reform in secondary English teaching. Yet, in confronting a wide range 
          of students, content questions, and social and cultural issues, reader 
          response approaches fall short. Potential answers and new directions for 
          English teaching have emerged under the umbrella of &quot;cultural 
          studies.&quot; This course contends that the starting point for curriculum and teaching methodology for teaching literature is addressing what the literature is about, <em>what</em> it means as well as <em>how</em> it means, in historical, cultural and social contexts.
        <p align="left">By focusing on difficult and potentially controversial 
            cultural studies curricular themes, students will gain understanding of  issues involved in 
            teaching literature at the secondary level, see <a href="engl480goals.html">Course Goals</a>. 
        You may also want to review the WMU teacher education <a href="http://www.wmich.edu/coe/intern/docs/indicat.doc">Program Goals</a>, which are the basis for the evaluation of intern teaching. 
        <p align="left">Changes in information technology are offering 
            to extend and reshape the teaching of literature. The inherited cultural 
            archive is now available on-line in formats and with complementary resources 
            that far exceed what is available in  textbooks.
        <p align="left">Class will be held in a wireless, laptop classroom in Wood Hall specifically 
            designed for English education courses. This room will allow us to integrate technology into literature 
            teaching in a &quot;classroom of the future.&quot; Our class will be organized 
            by our on-line syllabus that will also serve as an electronic, hyperlinked, 
            textbook. All students will develop and publish their own teaching website, 
            both a portfolio of work and a real-world working site for future teaching. 
            This website can serve as the basis of the portfolio required during intern 
            teaching. Obtain help for your technology projects at the <a href="http://www.wmich.edu/labs/06/itl.html">IT 
              Lab</a> on the Tower Bridge of the second floor of the Computer Center. 
        <p align="left">A significant portion of the class will be student-led, as we explore 
            the development of response-based, cultural studies literature teaching 
            within the context of NCTE and the State of Michigan standards, content expectations, and model curriculums. Student groups will select topics addressing current and 
            controversial themes such as  literature and the Third World, literature 
            and the environment (global warming?), literature and social class, literature and religion, 
            literature and sexuality, literature and sexual orientation, literature and service learning, literature 
            and the mass media, teaching Native American literature, literature and 
            white priviledge, literature and the Middle East, literature and the Iraq War, etc. <em>Expect to spend an additional twenty dollars on 
            books, packets, and reading materials for each of the student-led units</em> 
          -- this reading will be announced throughout the course.
        <p align="left">Course discussions will be significantly extended in the class on-line 
            discussion forum on our <a href="engl480nicenet.html">computer 
              conference</a>. Participation in the electronic conference and in the 
            professional activities are all included as part of class participation. 
        Our &quot;class name&quot; on Nicenet is &quot;4800 Spring 2008&quot; and our &quot;class key&quot; is &quot;822498848&quot; --  you will need this information to join the discussion.
        <p align="left">A substantial website focused on <a href="http://www.wmich.edu/teachenglish">Teaching 
            English Through Technology</a> has been developed to support this class 
            and will provide access to streaming videos, on-line resources, and our 
            own server space. Dr. Webb's website (<a href="http://www.allenwebb.net">www.allenwebb.net</a>) 
            is an additional resource for aspiring English teachers. I have worked with former secondary English students to create an extensive wiki about <a href="http://englishjob.wikispaces.com/">seeking a job teaching secondary English</a>.
        <p align="left"> As the capstone experience for English Education majors, this course 
            entails an exciting variety of professional activities and responsibilities. 
            Students are expected to attend a professional English teacher's conference, for example the MCTE sponsored &quot;<a href="http://writing.msu.edu/brightideas/">Bright Ideas Conference</a>&quot; in Lansing on April 12 or the <a href="http://michiganreading.org/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=26&Itemid=48">Michigan Reading Association Conference</a> in Detroit March 15-17. You should also join  <a href="http://www.ncte.org">NCTE</a>, <a href="http://www.mienglishteacher.org/">MCTE</a>, and/or <a href="http://www.michiganreading.org/">MRA</a> and read 
            regularly the <i>English Journal </i>or <i>Voices from the Middle</i>. 
        <p align="left">Information about the Michigan Teacher Certification test is available 
              on the <a href="http://www.mttc.nesinc.com/">MTTC website</a>.  I have a webpage of information for <a href="aspiringteachers.html">aspiring teachers</a> and wiki for <a href="http://englishjob.wikispaces.com">finding a job</a> teaching secondary English.

      <p> The final course grade will be an average of grades for the major assignments, 
        listed and weighted below. At the hour scheduled for the final exam students 
        will attend an intern teaching panel. Class participation is vital in 
        480, missing more than 3 classes may lower the grade and missing more 
        than 5 classes may lead to failing. This course will follow WMU policies 
      regarding <a href="honestypolicy.html">academic honesty</a>.

          Journal</a></i> at the NCTE website on-line using their membership number 
          as a password. Back issues are also in the Sangren <a href="http://www.library.wmich.edu/">Library 
          </a>under the call number PE1.E5. (Between Waldo (all issues before 
          1980) and Sangren (issues after 1980) we have back issues to 1912 when 
          the <i>English Journal</i> began publication--fascinating reading in 
          the history of secondary English teaching!) You can conduct an ERIC 
          search for articles on specific topics, for example for the unit you 
          will be leading, by setting &quot;English Journal&quot; as the &quot;source.&quot;        </p>
        <p> 2. Find three or more secondary English lesson plans available on 
          the web that you consider to be thoughtful and well-crafted. There are 
          many sources for Language Arts lesson plans on the web. Try <a href="http://home.cogeco.ca/%7Erayser3/">Outta 
          Ray's Head</a>, <a href="http://www.webenglishteacher.com/index.html">Web English Teacher</a>, the <a href="http://school.discovery.com/lessonplans/lit.html">Discovery School</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/subjects/languagearts_index.html">New 
          York Times Lesson Plan Archive</a>, <a href="http://www.sdcoe.k12.ca.us/score/cyberguide.html">Cyberguides</a>,

          Planz.com</a>, and, of course, <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>! </p>
        <p> 3. Drawing on at least three on-line lesson plans and three <i>English 
          Journal</i> articles, develop an annotated list of &quot;Teaching Ideas&quot; 
          with at least a paragraph of description and comments about how you 
          might use or modify the idea in your own classroom. Post this on your website page for teacher resources with links as appropriate. </p>
