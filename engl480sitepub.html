<p align="center">Introduction</p>
</u> 
<p align="left">The Information Technology department at WMU has been hard at 
  work attempting to make web publishing easier for students. Unfortunately, some 
  of the changes have actually made things more complicated, depending on which 
  html software you are using. On this page I will update what I know about web 
  publishing on the WMU server with the most specific help I can give. Soon WMU 
  will release the address of an official site to help students publish web pages. 
  If and when you find my or their instructions inadequate, don't hesitate to 
  call the University Help Desk, 387-5161 -- you pay for their service with your 
  tuition and fees!</p>
<p align="left">Teachers and aspiring teachers may want to examine my advice for 
  creating <a href="engl480site.html">interactive teaching web portfolios</a>.</p>

<p align="center"><u>WMU Server or Free Server??</u></p>
<p align="left">There are other ways to publish beside using the WMU server, and 
  there are many good free sites. (A few free sites include: <a href="http://geocities.yahoo.com/home/">geocities</a>, 
  <a href="http://www.homestead.com/">homestead,</a> <a href="http://live.altavista.com/">alta 
  vista</a>, and <a href="http://hometown.aol.com/">aol</a>. ) Free sites have 
  the advantage that they may be easier to use and come with prepackaged web publishing 
  pieces, such as templates, backgrounds, menu bars, buttons, images, counters, 
  visitor books, etc. At free sites you can usually upload pages you have developed 
  with your own html software as well using their templates. As a future teacher 
  it is good to be familiar with using free sites since it then be easy for you 
  to support your students' publishing and creating their own web pages on the 
  free sites.</p>
<p align="left">Free sites also have disadvantages. First off, they throw advertising 
  on to your web site every time pages are opened. The more the site is used the 
  more advertising seems to come up. Also, they have your email address and may 
  send advertising to your email. While it may be a bit more work to publish on 
  the WMU server, you do learn a bit better the mechanics of web publishing. At 
  the present time pages published on the WMU server are supposed to remain active 
  for nine months after graduation. At that time you could move your site to a 
  free server or to a school district server (assuming you are employed as a teacher.) 
  Once your site is created it should not be difficult to move it. Remember to 
  keep a copy of all of your pages on your own hard or floppy disk.</p>
<p align="center"><u>Setting Up Your WMU Web Folder</u></p>
<p align="left">The first step to publishing on the WMU server is to create a 
  &quot;www,&quot; world wide web, folder on the Unix server. So, you will need 
  a Unix account name and password. WMU students can take their bronco card to 
  the Bernhard Center or the Computer Center to get their unix account and password. 
  (When you log on the first time you will have to change your password.)</p>
<p align="left">To create your www folder you need to talk directly to the Unix 
  server. You do this using a &quot;telnet&quot; program. This program allows 
  you to give specific instructions to the unix server regarding your account. 
  Begin by:</p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p align="center"></p>
</font> 
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times">1. Opening &quot;NCSA Telnet&quot; (or any other telnet 
    program). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times">2. Hostname: unix.cc.wmich.edu or bronco.cc.wmich.edu 
    (both names go to the same server) (You may need to open new connection.) 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times">3. select &quot;unix&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times">4. at &quot;log in&quot; type your user name</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times">5. type your password</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times">6. at &quot;~&gt;&quot; type: makeweb (all lower case, 
    no space, hit return) This will create your www folder.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times">7. at &quot;~&gt;&quot; type: pwd (unix will list your 
    pathway, write it down carefully) This will give you the full pathway to your 
    folder. You will need this pathway to use the automatic publishing command 
    with Netscape Composer, although with Dreamweaver you do not need the full 
    pathway. Note: if you find that pages you are publishing can not be viewed 
    it may be because the computer people have moved your pages and you need to 
    check your pathway again with the pwd command.)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times">8. type &quot;exit&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="center"><u>Naming Your Pages</u></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Be sure that your home page has the name &quot;index.html.&quot; When your 
  account is viewed this index page will then be the first account that comes 
  up. When creating links to other pages that will be stored in your www folder 
  all you need for the address is the name of the page, eg. &quot;lessonplans.html.&quot; 
  For links to pages outside your own www folder, you need to put the full well 
  address starting with &quot;http://.&quot; Often publishing problems are caused 
  by names not matching. When you update any page or image you must publish over 
  the existing page by using the exact same name.</p>

<p>Publishing your pages means that you are basically transfering them from your 
  local disk to the web folder on your WMU account. This means using an &quot;FTP&quot; 
  or &quot;File Transfer Protocal&quot; program. Many html software programs, 
  such as Netscape Composer and Dreamweaver, have FTP programs built into them. 
  When you publish with a built-in program you can set it so that all associated 
  image and graphics files are published simultaneously. If you use a stand alone 
  FTP program (there are many freeware versions for PCs, for Macs use &quot;Fetch&quot;) 
  you will need to be sure all image and graphic files are also uploaded or else 
  your page will have broken puzzle piece icons or other errors.</p>
<p>If you are using Netscape Composer:</p>
<font face="Times"> 
<ol start=4>
  <p>1. Go to the file command &quot;publish&quot; </p>
  <p>2. Input the full file pathway. Example: </p>
  <p></p>
</ol>
<dir> 
  <p align="JUSTIFY">ftp://unix.cc.wmich.edu/home10/stugrp8f/UNIXUSERNAME/www/index.html 
    (Note: use &quot;ftp&quot; not &quot;http&quot; when publishing)</p>
</dir>
</font>
<p>If you are using Dreamweaver 3 or later.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>1. Go to the command &quot;publish.&quot;</p>
  <p>2. Input the address of the unix server, &quot;unix.cc.wmich.edu&quot; or 
    &quot;bronco.cc.wmich.edu&quot;</p>
  <p>3. Once the program has located your www folder, find your local folder and 
    push the arrow button to put your file up. (Be sure you have set the command 
    to publish associated pages.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are using a stand alone FTP program:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>1. Establish a new connection with the &quot;unix.cc.wmich.edu&quot; server 
    and the www folder at your user name (&quot;bronco.cc.wmich.edu&quot; is the 
    same server).</p>
  <p>2. Find the files you want to publish on your local disks, remembering that 
    all associated image or graphic files will need to be published separately.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><u>Making Your Pages Viewable</u></p>
<p>At the present time any student pages that are going to be viewable need to 
  have the privacy permissions changed. The first time that needs to be done by 
  the computer center and teachers need to provide a list of names to the IT office 
  so pages can be made viewable. Next, ever time after publishing a new page or 
  graphic image, the privacy permission must be turned off for that page. That 
  is accomplished by returning to the Telnet program described above under &quot;Setting 
  Up Your WMU Web Folder&quot;. At the&quot; ~&gt;&quot; prompt type &quot;fixweb.&quot; 
  The Information Technology people promise that soon this proceedure will no 
  longer be necessary.</p>
<p align="center"><u>Viewing Your Pages</u></p>
<p><font face="Times">Use Netscape (or other browser) to verify that your page 
  is published. Your web address is: http://unix.cc.wmich.edu/~UNIXUSERNAME. The 
  index page comes up with just your user name; other pages follow after your 
  username and a slash, for example, http://unix.cc.wmich.edu/~acareywe/York.html 
  would be the address for a page I published titled &quot;York.html.&quot;</font></p>
