            Expectations for Student-Led Units</font></font></h1>
          <center>
            <p align="left">Student-led units are an opportunity for all of us to learn more about how to do justice, inquiry, action teaching in secondary English. The goal is to help everyone learn how to develop integrated, thematic curriculum relevant to important issues in  the world and to the lives, cultural knowledge, and linguistic  background of secondary students.</p>
            <p align="left">Sudent leaders in our class are responsible for selecting reading, 
            developing class activities, creating assignments, and evaluating 
            student work. Teaching in this class should have the highest, broadest, 
            and most ethical expectations, be directed to the needs and interests 
            of the learners, and involve the best pedagogical practices. These 
            units are not intended to be &quot;practice&quot; teaching where you 
            try to create lessons appropriate to secondary students and your classmates 
            try to &quot;guess&quot; how secondary students might respond. Instead, 
            this is <i>real</i> teaching where your students are your colleagues, 
            all aspiring teachers planning to be certified as English teachers. You have 
            an opportunity to significantly influence their understanding and 
            approach as classroom teachers, and, in turn, influence literally thousands of students. 
          </p>
            <p align="left">Group learning, team teaching, and collegial collaboration 
              are a crucial part of teaching. Facilitating student learning calls 
              for a deep understanding of the group learning process. Thus a primary 
              objective of English 4800 is for all of us to develop and practice 
              our collaborative knowledge and skills. Preparing teaching units that teach other aspiring teachers about inquiry into meaningful subjects will require extensive time and effort including wide reading, library and internet
              research, writing, group discussion and decision making, and assessment 
              activities. All students are expected to take responsibility for 
              group work while cooperating with others in a professional, mutually 
              respectful, supportive, and critically reflective way. </p>
          </center><p align="left">Your group should start meeting immediately, during the first weeks of class, and then meet regularly, I suggest at least once a week. The group that goes first (and second) will need to be immediately active. Take note, below, of the date by which you need to be prepared to meet with the professor to go over your plan.
          <p align="left"> Perhaps to a greater extent than in any class you have 
            previously taken, you will take on the role of teacher and be responsible for the learning of your classmates. What do they most want and need to know? How can you create 
            active learning experiences that will facilitate their understanding 
            of how to help their future students inquire deeply and thematically into literature and the issues it raises? How can each group challenge itself to 
            provide us with innovative and meaningful content and learning experiences? </p>
          <p align="center"><font color="#000000"><b>Focusing the Topic and Selecting 
            Materials</b></font></p>
          <div align="left">
            <p>The topic you start with is likely broad and encompassing; complete courses could 
              be and are taught on it. As a student leader you are 
              responsible for learning your topic well, and, then, as a collaborative 
              group, making decisions about how to limit and focus the topic in order to be 
              most effective. Don't ask yourself, &quot;What does the professor 
              want us to do on this topic?&quot; Ask instead: &quot;How do we 
              think we could we best prepare students in this class to teach on this topic?&quot; </p>
            <p>You may want to give your unit a new, more focused title. Each class meeting should also have its own title or subtitle and there should be a clear and logical development from one class meeting to the next evident on the syllabus your group creates. While very interesting class activities and readings may spring immediately to mind, it is better to <em>start by establishing learning objectives about your topic and then develop reading and activities that will best attain those objectives. </em></p>
          </div>
          <p align="left"> Every unit should require <em>at least</em> 250 pages 
            of reading and <em>must include each of these elements</em>: </p>
        <p align="left"></center></div>
      <ul>
        <li> one or more selections from a standard 7-12 literature textbook (see 
           library ~LT5111.H25 or the Internet to find actual textbooks - textbooks today always have associated website with tables of contents, teaching materials, etc.); </li>
        <li>one or more articles from the <em>English Journal;</em></li>
        <li>supplimentary literary text(s) that could be taught in a secondary 
          English classroom (7-12) usually for student purchase, such as YA 
          novels or other literary works in multiple genres;</li>
        <li> examples of mass media, film, visual, oral, multimedia, or digital texts tied to the cultural studies content;</li>
        <li>additional reading of &quot;informational text,&quot; such as books, course pack, essays, articles, websites, archived texts, etc. that your group considers relevant. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is fair to expect 4800 students to read at the rate of about a novel 
        per week during the Fall or Spring semester. 
        It is also fair to expect that given sufficient advance warning students 
        in this class can rent and view commonly available videos outside of class 
        time. Book orders and packets need to be approved in advance by the professor. 
        All units are expected to include book orders and packets, yet the expense 
        of each unit should normally not exceed $20. Group leaders will need to order books and prepare copied packets or on-line resources in sufficient time so that they can be readily available to all class members. </p>
      <div align="center"> 
        <center>
          <p align="left"> Don't be afraid to ask classmates to purchase books 
            or materials that are likely to be of professional value! The capstone 
            course in your major, English 4800 is one of the most important 
            classes preparing you for your profession. Developing professional 
            knowledge, materials, and personal libraries are part of getting ready 
            to teach English. Try not to exceed the $20 budget, but remember that 
            for your classmates on tight budgets (most everyone!) there are options including borrowing materials from libraries, sharing 
            with other class members, reading literature straight from the web, 
            etc. </p>
          <p align="left"><p align="center"><b>Creating Assignments</b></p>
          <p align="left"> In addition to extensive reading, all units should 
            include significant writing. It is assumed that students in 4800 have 
            taken 4790, are familiar with teaching the writing process and are 
            ready to utilize a variety of writing strategies in their pedagogy. 
            Three to four pages of polished writing per week is fair to ask of 
            students in 4800 (in a Fall or Spring semester, twice that in Summer). This can be in the form of narrative or persuasive 
            writing, lesson plans, journals, free writing, etc. It is fair to 
            expect work to be typed and well-edited. </p>
          <p align="left"> Integrating technology, such as online discussion boards, the classroom websites, the Internet, virtual world activities, blogs, wikis, podcasts, social networking tools, educational software, etc. is required. Experiment with our wireless-laptop 
            computers, use websites, data projectors, powerpoint, digital story telling projects, 
            video, etc. Consider designing activities or making assignments using some 
            of the most cutting edge on-line 
            literature lesson ideas, <a href="archives.html">digital archives</a>, <a href="http://www.literaryworlds.org">virtual worlds</a>, etc. Your leadership team should create an on-line syllabus with links 
            to appropriate sites and activities, perhaps using <a href="http://www.wix.com/">Wix</a>. Here is a sample <a href="http://teachingsexualorientation.weebly.com/index.html">student-led unit website</a> from a previous class (notice that to see the syllabus on this site you download it as a Word document from a link).</p>
          <p align="left"><p align="left">Help prepare future teachers to work with diverse classrooms 
            that include a variety of academic skills, cultural backgrounds, ELL and 
            special needs students. 
          How can the teaching you envision be be individualized, draw on groups, and inspire all students?
          <p align="left"> Models of excellent assignments/projects should be 
            shared with the class. Student group leaders should be mindful of 
            the need of all students to prepare rich portfolios for teaching and 
            should find ways to encourage students to benefit from each other's 
            work. 
          <p align="center"><b>Assessment</b> 
          <p align="left"> Students are encouraged to develop authentic forms 
            of assessment that foster meaningful and ongoing learning. Expectations 
            for assignments should be clear in advance. A variety of components 
            may be involved in determining the grade for each unit, and careful 
            and thoughtful experimentation is encouraged. Self-evaluation should 
          be fostered.           
          <p align="left">While there should be clearly stated 
            minimum expectations, assignments should have no &quot;top&quot;-- students 
            should be encouraged to take projects as far as they would like to. 
          <p align="left">All major or unit assignments that are to receive a letter 
              grade must be read by at least three student leaders who must all 
              participate in the grade decision. Work should be returned to class members promptly and grades reported to each student and to the professor no more than 10 days after the end of the unit. Groups  are responsible for setting their own late paper or make-up work policies. 
          <p align="center"><b>Overall</b> 
          <p align="left"> Before each unit begins student leaders need to provide 
            the class with a syllabus for their unit which explains the focus 
            of the unit, the learning objectives, materials that need to be purchased, 
            and clearly spells out what reading/ assignments/ homework is expected, 
            when it is due, and how it will be evaluated. (As indicated above, this syllabus should be available on-line.) You want to be clear about what the other students are expected to do - one group made <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAEu_N0hpaE/daNGewpoNwdC2h1yXk-tzw/view?utm_content=DAEu_N0hpaE&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=recording_view">a short video that went along with the syllabus</a>; that seemed like a nice idea.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
          <p align="left"><p align="left">A rough draft of the 
            syllabus needs to be approved by the professor  as soon as possible after a tentative syllabus has been created, at least two days before 
            it is handed out to the class in a meeting attended by <em>all </em>group members. &nbsp;All students in the group need to attend this meeting which will usually last about 90 minutes. The discusion will include a detailed review of the tentative syllabus which should include all the items below. Student leaders should plan time after this meeting for continued syllabus development and fine tuning before it is handed out to the class.</p>
          <p align="left">At this meeting student leaders will be asked first for: </p>

<p align="left"> All student leaders are expected to take leadership 
            roles in all aspects of every lesson. It is not acceptable to simply 
            divide up the days giving one day to each student leader; real team 
            teaching is expected and will produce better results. All group members 
            should share in leadership roles in large group and small group activities, 
            outside of class as well as in front of the class. As much as possible 
            decisions should be reached on a consensus basis. Meetings to plan 
            group teaching that one or more students can not attend are likely 
            to lead to disagreement and frustration. Find times to meet when <em>all</em>            members of your group can attend -- and be sure to attend scheduled 
          meetings.          
          <p align="left"> Student leaders are expected to reflect together on their 
            teaching, preferably after each teaching session, and to revise lesson
