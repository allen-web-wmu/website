      Social justice issues have long been a concern of English language arts 
      teachers and of the literature they teach. We will draw on this rich tradition 
      as we bring to bear reader response, critical pedagogy, and cultural studies 
      theories and approaches. Working in collaboration with sections of English 
      480 taught by Dan Baker and Shannon Mortimore, we will explore social justice 
      as a primary theme for teaching literature. The experimental collaboration 
      between these three classes -- and perhaps other methods courses across 
      the country -- will provide synergy and enhance the learning community. 
      <p>Class will be held in a wireless, laptop classroom in Brown Hall specifically 
        designed for English education courses. The <a href="http://www.wmich.edu/teachenglish/subpages/classroom/eel.htm">English 
        Education Lab</a> will allow us to integrate technology into literature 
        teaching in a &quot;classroom of the future.&quot; Our course follows 
        this on-line syllabus that also serves as an electronic, hyperlinked text 
        book. All students will develop and publish their own teaching website, 
        both an electronic portfolio of work and a real-world working site for 
        future teaching. This project can become the basis of the portfolio required 
        during intern teaching. Obtain help for your technology projects at the 
        <a href="http://www.wmich.edu/labs/inst-tech.html">IT Lab</a> on the Tower 
        Bridge of the second floor of the Computer Center. 
      <p>A significant portion of the class will be student-led, as we explore 
        the development of response-based, cultural studies literature teaching 
        within the context of NCTE and State of Michigan content standards. Student 
        groups will addressing generative themes relevant to English studies and 
        social justice including gender and sexual orientation, religion and literature, 
        race and white priviledge in America, Native American studies, the &quot;Third 
        World,&quot; service learning.
      <p>A substantial website focused on <a href="http://www.wmich.edu/teachenglish">Teaching 
        English Through Technology</a> has been developed to support this class 
        and will provide access to streaming videos, on-line resources, and our 
        own server space. <a href="index.html">Dr. Webb's web site</a> (www.allenwebb.net) 
        is an additional resources for aspiring English teachers. You may want 
        to examine the<a href="http://www.wmich.edu/coe/teach_edu/exit.html"> 
        technology outcomes</a> expected of WMU education students. Always bring 
        floppy disks to class so you can retain copies of your work. Before the 
        end of the course, I urge you to burn a copy of your individual and content 
        websites and webquest on to a CD ROM. 
      <p> As the capstone experience for English Education majors, this course 
        entails an exciting variety of professional activities and responsibilities. 
        Students are expected to join the professional organizations, <a href="http://www.ncte.org">NCTE</a> 
        and <a href="http://www.msu.edu/user/mcte/mcte.html">MCTE</a>, and read 
        regularly the <i>English Journal </i>or <i>Voices from the Middle</i>. 
        There will be a variety of activities outside of regular class time. There 
        will be a technology panel on Jan 12, a workshop on teaching about civil 
        rights Jan 19 during MLK week, and a number of special speakers coming 
        to the English Departmetn during the semester (attend at least three). 
        You are also expected to attend the <a href="http://www.msu.edu/%7Emcte/Conferences.htm">Bright 
        Ideas Conference</a> in Lansing on Saturday, April 16th (register on-line 
        in advance). Presenting at a poster session at this conference (!) will 
        take the place of the regular take-home exam. 
      <p>Course discussions will be significantly extended in an <a href="engl480confer.html">electronic 
        conference</a> that we will share with other sections of English 480 to 
        develop an inclusive and mutually supportive teaching community. By the 
        end of the semester you should input 36,000 characters for an &quot;A&quot; 
        -- that will likely mean at least thirty minutes per week. Participation 
        in the electronic conference and in the professional activities listed 
        above are all included as part of class participation.
      <p> The final course grade will be an average of grades for the major assignments, 
        listed and weighted below. At the hour scheduled for the final exam students 
        will attend an intern teaching panel. Class participation is vital in 
        480, missing more than 3 classes may lower the grade and missing more 
        than 5 classes may lead to failing. This course will follow WMU policies 
        regarding <a href="honestypolicy.html">academic honesty</a>. This course 
        also supports the <a href="http://www.wmich.edu/wmu/news/1999/9909/9900-060.html">Safe

        <p>1. Read three or more articles from back issues of the <i>English Journal</i> 
          that interest you. You should subscribe to the <a href="http://www.ncte.org/store/journals/105390.htm"><i>English 
          Journal</i></a> and you can do so from its home website and view the 
          current issue. NCTE members can read back issues of the <i><a href="http://www.ncte.org/pubs/journals/ej/contents">English 
          Journal</a></i> at the NCTE website on-line using their membership number 
          as a password. Back issues are also in the Sangren <a href="http://www.library.wmich.edu/">Library 
          </a>under the call number PE1 .E5. (Between Waldo (all issues before 
          1980) and Sangren (issues after 1980) we have back issues to 1912 when 
          the <i>English Journal</i> began publication--fascinating reading in 
          the history of secondary English teaching!) You can conduct an ERIC 
          search for articles on specific topics, for example for the unit you 
          will be leading, by setting &quot;English Journal&quot; as the &quot;source.&quot; 
        </p>
        <p> 2. Find three or more secondary English lesson plans available on 
          the web that you consider to be thoughtful and well-crafted. There are 
          many sources for Language Arts lesson plans on the web. Try <a href="http://home.cogeco.ca/%7Erayser3/">Outta 
          Ray's Head</a>, the <a href="http://faldo.atmos.uiuc.edu/CLA/">Collaborative
