      <p align="center"><font size="5" color="#3399FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Teaching 
        Literature in the Secondary Schools</strong></font>
<p align="left">This section of English 4800 will ground students in traditional 
        approaches to literature pedagogy while simultaneously focusing on recent 
        waves of reform, reader response, cultural studies, and the impact of 
        the internet. We will use a thematic approach to integrate these approaches 
        as we explore a variety of cultural studies themes in a problem-posing, 
        student-led format. 
      <p align="left">For over a generation the reader response movement has generated 
        reform in secondary English teaching. Yet, in confronting a wide range 
        of students, content questions, and social and cultural issues, reader 
        response approaches fall short. Potential answers and new directions for 
        English teaching have emerged under the umbrella of &quot;cultural 
      studies.&quot;       
      <p align="left">Changes in information technology are offering 
        to extend and reshape the teaching of literature. The inherited cultural 
        archive is now available on-line in formats and with complementary resources 
      that far exceed what has been available in traditional textbooks.       
      <p align="left">We will 
        examine the legacy of reader response and the potential of cultural studies 
        and internet resources for exploring fundamental questions of why and 
        how to teach literature. By focusing on difficult and potentially controversial 
        issues, students will gain an understanding of the issues involved in 
        teaching literature at the secondary level, see <a href="engl480goals.html">Course Goals</a>.
 You may also want to review the WMU teacher education <a href="http://www.wmich.edu/coe/intern/docs/indicat.doc">Program Goals</a>, which are the basis for the evaluation of intern teaching. 
      <p>Class will be held in a wireless, laptop classroom in Sangren Hall that will allow us to integrate technology into literature 
        teaching in a &quot;classroom of the future.&quot; Our class will be organized 
        by our on-line syllabus that will also serve as an electronic, hyperlinked, 
        textbook. All students will develop and publish their own teaching website, 
        both a portfolio of work and a real-world working site for future teaching. 
        This website can serve as the basis of the portfolio required during intern 
        teaching. Obtain help for your technology projects at the <a href="http://www.wmich.edu/labs/06/itl.html">IT 
        Lab</a> on the Tower Bridge of the second floor of the Computer Center. 
      <p>A significant portion of the class will be student-led, as we explore 
        the development of response-based, cultural studies literature teaching 
        within the context of NCTE and the State of Michigan standards and content expectations. Student groups will select topics addressing current and 
            controversial themes such as  literature and the Third World, literature 
            and the environment (global warming?), literature and social class, literature and religion, 
            literature and sexual orientation, literature and service learning, literature 
            and the mass media, teaching Native American literature, literature and 
            white priviledge, literature and war (Iraq War?), etc.  Expect to spend an additional twenty dollars on 
        books, packets, and reading materials for each of the student-led units 
        -- this reading will be announced throughout the course.
      <p>Course discussions will be significantly extended in the class on-line 
        discussion forum on the &quot;English-Teacher&quot; <a href="engl480nicenet.html">Nicenet.org</a>. Our class is titled 4800 Summer 07 and the class key is: 5Z292Z2497. Participation in the electronic conference and in the 
        professional activities are all included as part of class participation. 
      <p>A substantial website focused on <a href="http://www.wmich.edu/teachenglish">Teaching 
        English Through Technology</a> has been developed to support this class 
        and will provide access to streaming videos, on-line resources, and our 
        own server space. Dr. Webb's website (<a href="http://www.allenwebb.net">www.allenwebb.net</a>) 
      is an additional resources for aspiring English teachers.
      <p> As the capstone experience for English Education majors, this course 
        entails an exciting variety of professional activities and responsibilities. 
        Students are expected to join the professional organizations, <a href="http://www.ncte.org">NCTE</a> 
        and <a href="http://www.mienglishteacher.org/">MCTE</a>, and read 
        regularly the <i>English Journal </i>or <i>Voices from the Middle</i>. 
        Information about the Michigan Teacher Certification test is available 
        on the <a href="http://www.mttc.nesinc.com/">MTTC website</a>. 
      <p>This highly condensed summer semester course  offers   4-credit hours at double speed. We 
        are meeting 7 hours per week in class, with substantial reading, course work, and meetings 
        with student groups outside of class time. It will difficult to be successful 
        in in this class  if you are taking 
        other courses or working many hours<em>.</em>
      <p>Class participation is vital in 4800 and one class meeting of a summer 
        course equals a full week during the regular semester. Missing more than 
        2 classes will lower the grade and missing more than 3 classes may lead 
        to failing. 
      <p>The final course grade will be an average of grades for the major assignments, 
        listed and weighted below. At the hour scheduled for the final exam students 
        will attend an intern teaching panel. This course will follow WMU policies 
        regarding <a href="honestypolicy.html">academic honesty</a>. This course 
        also supports the <a href="http://www.wmich.edu/wmu/news/1999/9909/9900-060.html">Safe 
        on Campus</a> environment (387-2123); <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0435070053/102-8186383-6519306?v=glance">The

      <blockquote> 
        <p>Introduction to <i>English Journal</i> and Teaching Resources Web Site 
          Workshop and Mini-lessons</p>
        <p>1. Read carefully through the entire on-line syllabus, including all 
          assignments. Bring any questions about these assignments to class.</p>
        <p>2. Read three or more articles from back issues of the <i>English Journal</i> 
          that relate to the theme of the student-led group you are in. You should 
          subscribe to the <a href="http://www.ncte.org/store/journals/105390.htm"><i>English 
          Journal</i></a> and you can do so from its home website and view the 
          current issue. NCTE members can read back issues of the <i><a href="http://www.ncte.org/pubs/journals/ej/contents">English 
          Journal</a></i> at the NCTE website on-line using their membership number 
          as a password. Back issues are also in the Sangren <a href="http://www.library.wmich.edu/">Library</a> under the call number PE1 .E5. (Between Waldo (all issues before 
          1980) and Sangren (issues after 1980) we have back issues to 1912 when 
          the <i>English Journal</i> began publication--fascinating reading in 
          the history of secondary English teaching!) You can conduct an ERIC 
          search for articles on specific topics by setting &quot;English Journal&quot; 
          as the &quot;source.&quot; </p>
        <p> 3. Find and examine three or more secondary English lesson plans available 
          on the web relevant to your theme that you consider to be well crafted. 
          There are many sources for Language Arts lesson plans on the web. Try 
          <a href="http://home.cogeco.ca/%7Erayser3/">Outta Ray's Head</a>, 
          <a href="http://www.sitesforteachers.com/resources_sharp/language_arts/languagearts.html">Sites for Teachers</a>, 
          <a href="http://school.discovery.com/lessonplans/lit.html">Discovery School</a>,<a href="http://www.webenglishteacher.com/index.html">Web English Teacher</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/subjects/languagearts_index.html">New

          Planz.com</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com">etc</a>. </p>
        <p>4. Write a one paragraph description of each of the journal articles 
          and lesson plans that you have selected. Post these paragraphs to the page on your website for teachers or colleagues.          </p>
        <p>3. Study closely <a href="http://www.wmich.edu/teachenglish/subpages/technology/teaching_resources.htm">web 
          resources</a> for teachers and students. Look at <a href="http://www.wmich.edu/teachenglish/subpages/technology/webresearch.htm">Web 
          Research </a>sites and on-line <a href="http://www.wmich.edu/teachenglish/subpages/literature/lit.htm">Literature 
          Resources</a>, including <a href="http://www.beyondbooks.com">BeyondBooks</a>, <a href="http://www.literaryworlds.org">Literary Worlds</a>, and other sites that support literature scholarship. Seek out webpages 
          and websites that you would like to link to for your teaching website. 
          Choose a website that you think might be especially useful and post
