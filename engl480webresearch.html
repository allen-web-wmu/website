        <p align="left">For this assignment you will closely examine two web resources, 
          one for secondary English teachers and one for secondary English students. 
          I have identified some excellent sites for teachers and students as 
          well as professional organization sites for teachers. You should look 
          at these and the whole class needs to learn about them. I also welcome 
          you heading out on your own--help me expand my list! Can you find good 
          sites on secondary English content, literature, culture, writing, etc.? 
        </p>
        <p align="left">Write the equivalent of one page on each resource and 
          post this page on the appropriate item on the class confer. Please include 
          a hyperlink to the sites you are analyzing. </p>
        <p align="left">How would this site serve as a useful resources for teachers 
          (or students)? What are the strengths and weaknesses of this site for 
          teaching and learning secondary English? Are they pedagogically sound? 
        </p>
        <p align="left">Prepare to present your selected websites to the class. 
          Some of these sites are huge--what pages will be most important for 
          us to see? What do you want to say about these pages? Help us think 
          critically and carefully about content and delivery. </p>
        <p align="left">From your own research and that of your classmates, collect 
          the best resources and include links and brief annotations to these 
          sites on your website on both your student and teacher pages.<br>
