        <p align="left">Drawing on a theme related to our course that interests you, analyze two or more texts (written and/or visual) that you have read/viewed for this course. Use both close, careful and critical reading /  viewing <em>and</em>  research in  secondary materials including scholarly sources. (The <a href="https://libproxy.library.wmich.edu/login?qurl=http%3a%2f%2fwww.csa.com%2fhtbin%2fdbrng.cgi%3fusername%3dbee82%26access%3dbee8282%26db%3dmla-set-c%26adv%3d1">MLA bibliography</a> is one place to find scholarly resources.)  
        <p align="left">Postcolonial analysis lends itself to various kinds of 
        cultural studies projects that bring together social, political, economic and/or historical issues with the analysis of cultural works. As your paper considers two or more works, it will to some extent be comparative. In that comparison  it may be interesting to consider difference and nuance as well as continuity and similarity.
        <p align="left">I am interested to see  your thinking become complex and  your idesa develop and progress. Rather than simply proving a point or defending a thesis, it might equally or more interesting to explore a specific problem, question, or well-defined issue.
        <p align="left">Papers by undergraduates should be at least 8-10 pages and by graduate students 15 pages or more.
        
        <p align="left"><strong>Teaching Unit
        </strong>
        
        <p align="left">A teaching unit should draw on themes and texts from our postcolonial study of the Middle East to develop a course of study approximately six to eight weeks long. The grade-level, 7-16, and the  
          objectives of the unit should be 
          clearly specified. 
        <p align="left">Your unit should  demonstrate  high expectations for student learning and work, inclusion of a variety of literary and cultural materials, and the use of new technology to support learning. Writing assignments and the writing process should be clearly 
          integrated into your unit. 
        <p align="left"> The curriculum project should include:
        <p align="left">1. An  introduction that describes the goals, selection of reading and activities of your unit.  
        <p align="left"> 2. An outline or syllabus that sets forward the schedule 
          of the reading and writing assignments, topics of discussion, tests, 
          and other activities. 
        <p align="left">3. Additional teaching materials you have developed including: sample plans for individual 
          lessons, study questions, threaded discussion questions, essay tests, 
          paper topics, lecture notes, power point presentations, assignments, handouts, etc.
        <p align="left">The project can be turned in as a paper or be published to the web, as website (eg. <a href="http://sites.google.com">Google Sites</a>) or wiki (eg. <a href="http://www.wikispaces.com/">Wikispaces</a>).        
        
        <p align="left">Assume that you have maximum freedom to 
          design the course, purchase materials, and access technology.
        <p align="left">Teaching units are generally longer than research papers, for undergraduates at least 15 pages and for graduate students at least 20.
