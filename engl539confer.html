  Conference</font></u></font></h1>
<p>The computer conference, &quot;Postcolonial,&quot; will add a rich discussion 
  forum to our course. 
<p> To use this conference you need to have your WMU computer account username 
  and password. Enter the confer name as &quot;postcolonial.&quot; On your first 
  visit to the confer you must &quot;join&quot; as a &quot;participant.&quot; 
  Afterwards you will find it easy to access all items by using the &quot;Describe 
  Items&quot; button--it will remember which items and responses you have read..
<p>Confer entries should be thoughtful and respond to the ideas of other students. 
  Reading student entries is as important as entering your own responses. You 
  can make any web page an automatic hyperlink to the confer by typing in the 
  web address preceeded by &quot;http://&quot;. When you want to respond to an 
  item, you can do so by hitting &quot;respond&quot; at the bottom of the item. 
  &quot;Creating a New Item&quot; should be reserved for starting a new discussion 
  on a new topic.
<p>The confer can be accessed at <a href="http://vms.cc.wmich.edu/www/confer/">http://vms.cc.wmich.edu/www/confer</a>. 
<p>It is important to start early with the confer, in the first weeks of the course, 
  and keep up with it. Use professional manners, while being informal at the same 
  time. Don't &quot;flame&quot; other people's responses -- it is often a good 
  idea to reread an entire item before reacting too quickly to an upsetting comment 
  from another student. </p>
<p>The confer measures the number of characters entered, to check your confer 
  usage use command &quot;Participant Response Statistics.&quot; All students 
  who have entered 30,000 characters in thoughtful and interactive responses will 
  receive an &quot;A&quot; for their confer portion of their participation grade. 
  (This is approx. 2000 characters per week, or an average of 30 minutes/week 
  reading and writing--focus text assignments are turned in on the confer and 
  count toward your total characters.) <br>
