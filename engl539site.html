    <p>&nbsp; 
    <p align="left">The written work for this class will be the continued development 
      of the colonial/postcolonial literary dialogues web site with pages for 
      every text read and pages introducing and connecting specific literary dialogues 
      around the focus texts.&nbsp; Pages will demonstrate a mastery of the academic 
      content of the course, high-quality scholarship, library and web research, 
      html literacy, graphic and artistic skill, and include materials for teachers, 
      and extensive links to on-line resources.&nbsp; The web&nbsp;site will be 
      created for the use of scholars, teachers, and students interested in postcolonial 
      literature and its dialogues with the British and American literary canons. 
    <div align="left"><br>
      Web pages should be written so as to be useful for students, teachers, and 
      scholars from the last two years of high school through graduate school. 
      When completed the site should be able to serve as an electronic textbook 
      for high school or university courses in British or World Literature with 
      a multicultural focus and/or courses in Postcolonial Literature. The site 
      may be used by specific courses as a supplement to traditional instruction 
      or it may become integrated into virtual learning high schools or universities 
      or it may become a central activity for home schooled or independent learners. 
      The site should also serve as a gateway to literary resources on the web 
      and as a repository of scholarship. </div>
  </center>
  <p align="left">Each student will construct four pages, three on specific literary 
    texts and one on a theme of the student's own choosing. Texts from genres 
    underrepresented on the course syllabus, such as poetry, drama, film, historical 
    materials, etc. are welcome. Once pages are in progress, it may be important 
    to link pages with those made by other student groups in the class.
