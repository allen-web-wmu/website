  1. <font color="#000000">Discussion Questions</font> 
<p> 
<center>
  <p align="left">Write five to ten high quality discussion questions about the 
    focus text that we can use in class to help us better understand the focus 
    text. </p>
  <p align="left">Guidelines for discussion questions:</p>
</center>
<blockquote> 
  <p>1) Good discussion questions are not answered by &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no.&quot; 
    Instead they lead to <i>higher order thinking</i><b> </b>(analysis, synthesis, 
    comparison, evaluation) about the work and the issues it raises. 
  <p>2) Good discussion questions call for more than simply recalling facts or 
    guessing what the teacher already wants to know, but are <i>open-ended</i>, 
    leading to a variety of responses. Good questions recognize that readers will 
    have different perspectives and interpretations and such questions attempt 
    to engage readers in dialogue with each other.<br>
    <br>
  
  <p>3) Good discussion questions depend on a <i>careful reading</i> of the text. 
    They often cite particular scenes or passages and ask people to look at them 
    closely and draw connections between these passages and the rest of the work.<br>
    <br>
  <p>4) Good discussion questions are simply and <i>clearly stated</i>. They do 
    not need to be repeated or reworded to be understood.<br>
  </p>
  <p>5) Good discussion questions are <i>useful</i> to the students. Good questions 
    can help to clarify passages or issues students may find difficult. They help 
    students understand cultural differences that influence their reading. They 
    invite personal responses and connections. </p>
  <p> 6) Good discussion questions <i>make (and challenge) connections</i> between 
    the text at issue and other works, and the themes and issues of the course. 
  </p>

  <p> 2. Web Site Information<U><B><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><BR>
    </FONT></B></U></p>
  <p align="left">For each of the focus texts that we read several students will 
    be asked to gather information from the web that will be useful to our understanding 
    of the text under consideration. This information could be on the text itself, 
    the author, the themes of the work, specific and relevant historical background, 
    etc. Bring to class a list of at least five quality web sites and be prepared 
    to speak briefly on the information you have gathered. The web information 
    you gather may be especially useful to the students who will be developing 
    web pages related to this focus text. </p>
  <p align="center">3. Library Research</p>
  <p align="left">For each of the focus texts that we read several students will 
    be asked to gather information from the library that will be useful to our 
    understanding of the text under consideration. This information could be on 
    the text itself, the author, specific literary criticism on the text, the 
    themes of the work, specific and relevant historical background, etc. Include 
    an MLA search in your library research. Scholarship that addresses postcolonial 
    dimensions of the focus text will be especially interesting to us. Bring to 
    class at least three quality articles or books and be prepared to speak briefly 
    on the about them. The library information you gather may be especially useful 
    to the students who will be developing web pages related to this focus text.</p>
