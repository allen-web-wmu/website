        <p>During our seminar you will engage in three reading/viewing/ research and presentation projects one in each area we are exploring, Afrofuturism, Indigenious futurism, and Chicano/Latin@ futurism. </p>
			  <p>You can focus on either with a traditional text from African/African American, Native American, and Chicano/Latin@ literary "canons" or with a recent futuristic literary work, film, short story collection, or other cultural expression.</p> 
        <p data_temp_dwid="1">You can choose works from the list suggested on the syllabus or that you find on your own (I recommend running the title by me). The idea is to read something that is new to you rather than report on something you already know. You can choose works that you might use in your <a href="engl6780futurismproject.html" target="blank">final project</a>, but that is not required.</p>
        <p data_temp_dwid="1">After reading/viewing/researching this work, create a short <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/" target="blank" data_temp_dwid="2">Google Slide presentation </a> that: </p>
        <p>1) introduces the work - describes what it is about, could include some character, plot, and/or setting description, info on author, genre, etc. if relevant.</p>
        <p data_temp_dwid="4">2) makes connections and/or distinctions with "futurism" - could identify and describe particular aspects/themes/issues that seem to fit with or contradict futuristic texts we have read or with our developing concepts of what "futurism" means;</p>
        <p>3) describes 1-3 teaching ideas that help students inquire, explore, examine, connect key issues in the work - could be a particular analysis or creative writing assigment, reading or discussion questions, research project, group project, student presentation, multimedia, visual, or video project, service learning activity, etc. &nbsp;This/these teaching idea/s might or might not become part of your final project.</p>
        <p>Send the URL for your Google Slide show to <a href="mailto:allen.webb@wmich.edu">allen.webb@wmich.edu</a> before midnight on the night of the day before our seminar meeting. I will post these on our syllabus so that they will be easy to present and available to everyone.</p>
        <p>Present your slide show to the class. You will have 10 minutes. Practice your presentation before giving it, so that you can make an interesting and effective presentation in the time allowed. &nbsp;Use good presentation skills - slides can include key points, but have much more to say than just reading your slides! Images welcome.</p>
