        <p align="left"> I feel that I have not only learned a considerable amount of theory in this course, I have also put much of it into practice. The course has made me step back several times and really examine what it is I'm teaching, why I am teaching, and the approach I will take as I continue to teach. Each time I implemented a new idea it has improved my teaching and the environment of the classroom. The real reward has come in my&nbsp;student's response to me as a teacher... My students' grades have improved and my stress is less. I think this is proof that my teaching is improving and what I have learned in this course is effective.

        <p align="left">Asking questions is always a dangerous thing for me because it means that I am heading toward a paradigm shift. And I have had one. I was quickly on my way to becoming just another burnt out teacher in the inner city. I was feeling discouraged because of so many things in my district. The reading in this class... helped me dive further into how I want to teach... The class left me feeling rejuvinated and ready to teach another day.... This class has provided me with the tools to get my students thinking more deeply about what I teach.

        <p align="left">This course has opened my eyes and given me a wealth of information to use in improving my teaching. I thought I was pretty well-off before this class, only a bit ignorant about how to teach <em>literature</em> instead of how to teach at all. But the environment of this class soon overwhelmed me (in a good way). I hate to admit it, but since we're being honest, I was one of those people who thought subconsciously that literature was the hard path and education was the easy path... I had been conditioned through my constant exposure with other literature people to feel somehow among the elite. So before anything else, I'm sorry for that. I've learned that nothing could be further from the truth.

        <p align="left">English 6800 has been a wonderful course and learning experience. At the beginning, I felt leagues behind my peers who are already teaching literature courses, but this class helped me catch up with them... My fellow students in English 6800 have extremely diverse backgrounds and their experience is worth learning from... I am much more prepared to teach literature than ever before because I was able to analyze every aspect of my future literature course.

        <p align="left">I can honestly say that I can't remember having another class in which virtually all the reading was meaningful... I am in great admiration of the relaxed and yet carefully constructed and even controlled way Dr. Webb leads discussions. I like to think I lead discussions in my classroom in a similar way, but definitely without the skill, pacing, and finessse of stopping someone from going on too long or encouraging the quieter one to speak. Because I knew each discussion would be rich, I didn't want to miss a single class.

        <p align="left">In the half dozen or so years since I last crosssed paths with Dr. Webb I had, beneath the burdens of time and stress, almost forgotten where my passion for teaching lay. Fortunately for me, Dr. Webb hadn't lost that same passion for giving voices to the unheard that he had when I was one of his undergraduate students. Reconnecting with Dr. Webb and that passion helped  to reconnect me to the idealism and passion I had as a novice teacher. To recover the passion you had before experience battered you about, but retaining the benefit of that experience, is a valuable gift.

        <p align="left">Thanks to the book <em>Literature and the Web</em> and the contributions of classmates my &quot;technical&quot; skills have improved 110 percent and I now want to incorporate some type of wiki, webpage, or website into every class I teach. In the past this has also been something I felt was beyond my area of expertise and might be impossible to tackle. I also didn't know where to start. Now I can also see the benefits of using multiple types of technology, and am currently building a site for my summer class. I realize this will actually end up saving me time, as it's easier to be better organized when I am keeping an interactive class site up and running. In addition I feel like it will allow students to explore further; become more interested in class materials and discover new paths.
