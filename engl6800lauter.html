      <p>An image has long haunted the study of American culture. It limits our 
thought, shapes our values. We speak of the "mainstream," implying the existence of other 
work, minor rills and branches. In prose, the writing of men like Emerson, Thoreau, 
Hawthorne, Melville, James, Eliot, Hemingway, Faulkner, and Bellow constitute the 
mainstream. Others–writers of color, most women writers, "regional" or "ethnic" writers–
might, we said, be assimilated into the mainstream, though probably they would continue 
to serve as tributaries, interesting and often sparkling but, finally, less important. They 
would, we assumed, be judged by the standards and aesthetic categories we had developed 
for the canonical writers. We acknowledged that including in the canon writers like 
Wharton, Cather, Chopin, and Ralph Ellison might, at best, change somewhat our 
definition of the mainstream, but the intellectual model based on the Great River theory of 
American letters has persisted even among mildly revisionist critics (see, e.g., Bercovitch, 
Reconstructing). Such critics have continued to focus on a severely limited canon of 
"major" writers based on historical and aesthetic categories from this slightly augmented 
mainstream.</p>
<p>The problem we face is that the model is itself fundamentally misleading. The United 
States is a heterogeneous society whose cultures, while they overlap in significant respect, 
also differ in critical ways. A normative model presents variations from the mainstream as 
abnormal, deviant, lesser, perhaps ultimately unimportant. That kind of standard is no 
more helpful in the study of culture than is a model, in the study of gender differences, in 
which the male is considered the norm, or than paradigms, in the study of minority or 
ethnic social organization and behavior, based on Anglo-American society. What we need, 
rather, is to pose a comparative model for the study of American literature. That may seem 
like an odd concept, especially coming from a North American academic. Few branches of 
academe in the United States have been so self-consciously indifferent to comparative 
study as has been the field we call "American literature." While we have, for example, 
studied Spanish or French influences on American writing, and vice versa, we have seldom 
been trained in any truly comparative discipline, and the academic journals that serve the
American literature professoriat certainly offer no comparative perspective. Nevertheless, only
what we might call 'comparative American studies" will lead us out of the distortions and
misunderstandings produced by the 
mainstream and tributary framework.</p>

<p>This essay presents a strategy for approaching the many and varied literatures of the 
United States. It is not conceived as an overview of "marginalized" literatures, except to 
the extent that it underlines certain areas of critical practice that, I think, we must 
reexamine if we are to contemplate these literatures with accuracy, let alone respond to 
them with verve. In this sense, what I am presenting may be thought of more as counsel to 
explorers than as a map of the territory. While parts of the territory are well known, and 
others are coming into view, what is being found has not yet fully been absorbed or 
shared. By "marginalized" I designate those writings that, by virtue of their subject matter 
(e.g., menstruation ether than learning to hunt), function (propagandistic, ceremonial 
rather than belletristic), formal elements and conventions (improvisational, epistolary 
rather than organic, dramatic), audience (women, Spanish speakers rather than white 
men), or other factors, have been esteemed relatively less significant to, not at the center 
of, the definition of a nation's culture. Marginalized works are, largely, the products of 
groups who have relatively less access to political, economic, or social power. To say it 
another way, the works generally considered central to a culture are those composed and 
promoted by persons from groups holding power within it. Thus, as my definition and my 
examples suggest, we are concerned with the work of women as well as that of minority 
men–for while there are profound differences between a culture defined significantly in 
terms of gender and one defined significantly in terms of race or national origin, 
nevertheless the burdens and opportunities posed by marginality generate unusually 
significant parallels. And thus, finally, we are discussing the writing of a majority of the 
people of this nation, a majority whose cultures, I would argue, continue to be less than 
fully understood or appreciated by virtue of the factors I examine here.</p>

<p>I want to look, first, at conceptions of literary history and the ideas of significance in 
subject that inform historical constructs. Subsequently, I shall discuss the functions of 
imaginative writing, and then the problem of evaluating differing forms and conventions. 
Finally, I shall turn to questions of characteristic patterns of imagery and language, and to 
audience as a problematic. Of course, I can hardly scratch the surface of these issues, 
central to critical discourse. My intent, rather, is to illustrate how a comparative approach 
to the literatures of America can help recast our assumptions about these matters.</p>

<p>An advantage of a comparative model is that it allows us to discard the notion that all 
literatures produced in this country must be viewed through the critical lenses shaped to 
examine mainstream–that is, largely white and male–culture. We can then begin to see 
that, for example, subjects and forms invoked by African American writers are influenced 
not only by the traditions of Anglo-European literature but by indigenous folk and formal 
cultures of black communities in the United States and elsewhere. We can note that for 
many "hyphenated" Americans, the tension between assimilation in and separation from 
the majority helps define theme and plot–exemplified by the frequent concern with the 
mulatto, half-breed, greenhorn–a phenomenon largely absent from the work of majority 
writers. Stepping outside mainstream assumptions, we can ask not whether or how any 
work fits an established cultural pattern or given formal structure, but rather how it is that 
people within a particular social group or class– including white men–speak, sing, write to one
another (and perhaps to others) and what are, for them, significant concerns, appropriate forms,
desirable artistic goals. Beyond that, the comparative study of American literatures allows us to
reexamine traditionally 
established works from fresh perspectives provided by minority and white female texts. 
Frederick Douglass's use of books illuminates in quite new ways Emerson's ideas of the 
value of letters; Harriet Jacobs's [Linda Brent's] years in an attic cast an oblique light on 
Thoreau's more comfortable notions of simplification, of where one lives and what one 
lives for; the radically similar cultural origins of works by Stowe and Hawthorne force on 
us a certain decentering of the latter, a necessary reconstruction of how we understand 
antebellum fiction. Most of all, a comparative strategy allows us to see Anglo-European, 
male writing as but one voice, albeit loud and various, in the chorus of "American" 
culture.</p>

<p>Of course, a comparative study brings its own problems. Indeed, one particular 
difficulty rises as a main bar to this approach: the limitation of our own training and 
knowledge. Marge Piercy offers a cautionary portrait of the blinders often imposed by 
graduate training:

... English is a hierarchical department.... We are taught the narrowly defined Tradition, 
we are taught Structure, we are taught levels of Ambiguity. We are taught that works of 
art refer exclusively to other works of art and exist in Platonic space. Emotion before art is 
dirty. We are taught to explicate poems and analyze novels and locate Christ figures and 
creation myths and Fisher Kings and imagery of the Mass. Sometimes I look up and 
expect to see stained-glass windows on our classroom. Somewhere over our heads like a 
grail vision lurks a correct interpretation and a correct style to couch it in. We pick up the 
irony in the air before we comprehend what there is to be ironic about. (274-75)

In these familiar precincts, where the ironic stance precedes the emotional response and 
art works are held up for arm's-length scrutiny, what can become of the Toni Morrison's 
Bluest Eye or James Welch's Winter in the Blood? </p>

<p>A second  set of difficulties arises from the uneven development of the cultures of the 
United States.  "Uneven development" suggests more than the obvious fact that different 
groups established themselves in this land at quite different times. The term implies, first, 
a point about chronology: the relationship between the arrival of an immigrant group on 
these shores and the emergence of a literary (i.e., written) culture (or the beginning of the 
written articulation of an oral culture) is quite irregular. A literary culture requires, 
obviously enough, literacy. Only some of the groups that came to this country, or were 
here, were literate–in their own languages, much less in English. Many immigrants were 
rural peoples, like this land's original inhabitants, with strongly established but not literary 
cultures.  At the turn of the century, Jewish--at least male--garment workers in New York 
(as well as Welsh miners in Colorado) were among the most "literate" of immigrant 
workers.  That might help to explain the relatively rapid and widespread emergence of a 
significantly Jewish, as distinct from a Polish or Italian, literate culture.</p>

<p>Then, too, development of a literary culture requires the diffusion through a group of 
a set of ideas, particularly the notion that it is possible or valid for a person to devote time 
to the wonderfully arrogant act of artistic composition. Hawthorne had a good deal to say 
about that in the "Custom House," though his reflections, particular to his male, 
New England, Puritan immigrant heritage, differ strikingly from those, on the one hand, of 
mid-nineteenth-century women writers, like Caroline Kirkland or Fanny Fern, who felt 
forced by possible social disapproval to discount their own "scribblings," and, on the 
other, of Anzia Yeziergka in Red Ribbon on a White Horse, Tillie Olsen in Silences or 
Maxine Hong Kingston in The Woman Warrior.  Finally, a literary culture requires  the 
existence of an audience, a reading public that resonates to the beat of the writers' 
language and concern.. An audience imbued with ideas about the value of producing 
literary art may provide institutional means for supporting artists, including publishing 
outlets, networks for distribution, opportunities for artists to concentrate on creation. The 
importance of such material supports to the evolution of a literary
culture can hardly be overestimated (see Madhubuti). Differences in literacy, diffusion of 
ideas, and means of support help explain why the establishment of literary culture in one 
group does not predict its development in another.</p>

<p>We can identify a second critical point about "uneven development":  literary culture 
emerges in a minority or marginalized group in part independently of, in part in response 
to,
development in the majority culture. This comes as no surprise: linguistic traditions differ; 
concerns and subjects differ; popular oral expressions differ from written; audiences differ; 
institution. extend their support unevenly. Finally, the functions of culture in the life of a 
group of people change significantly over time, as social realities and evolving 
consciousness, about them change. For all these reasons, the literary history of the 
dominant white and male culture will only in a limited degree be a useful account of the 
development of the varied literary culture. of the United States. A full literary history of 
this country requires both parallel and integrated accounts of differing literary traditions 
and thus of differing (and changing) social realities.1
 We are only at the beginning of the creation of such a complex history.</p>

II

<p> The structures of literary study are based, as Geoffrey Hartman has acknowledged, 
on limited "text milieux" (299). That is, we derive aesthetic and historical theories from a 
selection of works, often lifted from their historical contexts and quite limited in outlook 
and even form. In general our choice of these texts is rooted in assumptions based on the 
particular characteristics, of our class, race, and sex, reshaped, to be sure, by the powerful 
influence exerted–especially over those of us from minority or ethnic origins–by the 
professors of the dominant culture. From this limited set of texts we project standards of 
aesthetic excellence as well as the intellectual constructs we call "literary history."  And 
once we have developed such constructs, we view other works in their terms, whether the 
works originate from that initial "text milieu" or from outside it.2 That commonplace and 
hardly conscious procedure helps explain the apparently self-evident character of the 
canon. It also produces serious distortions in value judgments (as I shall suggest below) as 
well as in historical accounts of literary development.</p>

<p>Consider, as an example of faulty literary history, what was until the late 1970s the 
usual portrait of the evolution of fiction in North America (a portrait that still shapes 
curricular choices). Writers like Charles Brockden Brown, Washington Irving, and James 
Fenimore Cooper, it was said, were forerunners, who cleared and plowed the colonial 
cultural wilderness so that, in the "American Renaissance," the first generation
of major writers–Poe, Hawthorne, Melville--could flourish; They were succeeded by
three generations of fiction writers: Twain and James, who elaborated alternative west-
ward-looking and eastward-looking subjects and styles; realists and naturalists, like 
Howells, Crane, and Dreiser; and finally, in the 1920s, a new, modernist renaissance, 
exemplified by the work of Faulkner, Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Dos Passos, and a host of 
others.</p>

<p>If this chronology were a broadly useful historical account, it should illuminate the 
texts of writers other than those whose work forms its basis. What then might it tell us of 
the first group of black novelists? William Wells Brown's Clotel (1853), Frank Webb's 
Garies and Their Friends (1857), Martin Delany's Blake (1859), and Harriet Wilson's Our 
Nig (1859) are roughly contemporaries of The Scarlet Letter (1850) and Moby-Dick} 
(1851). Read in terms of Hawthorne's and Melville's works, they seem painfully under-
developed, in places even crude and propagandistic. But to view them in such a perspec-
tive would, I think, be unhelpful and an error in historical understanding. In one sense the 
novelists are more the contemporaries of a writer like Cooper and share many of his 
shortcomings–and virtues. For these black writers are only beginning the process of 
establishing a novelistic style for their culture and of elaborating, in that style, fictional 
material of consequence to the audience to which they aspire. In another, metaphoric, 
sense their texts reach back to the semiautobiographical fictions of Elizabethan and 
Jacobean writers.</p>

<p>But the comparisons with The Last of the Mohicans or The Unfortunate Traveler are 
in other respects equally misleading, since they would obscure what were undoubtedly the 
major cultural influences on these books: the well-established tradition of black slave 
narratives, the African American oral tradition of tales and legends, and the publication of 
Uncle Tom's Cabin(1852). The narratives and Stowe's novel helped establish and broaden 
an audience for which reading and writing was integrated with social activism; an audience 
that responded to images of heroic and adventurous black men and women and was 
willing to confront the complex realities of the oppression, particularly sexual, of black 
women; that also accepted the very idea of a black writer–a problematic conception for 
many people, even some blacks, in antebellum America. Further, a historical account to 
which the slave narratives, Stowe, and the black oral tradition are integral helps. us' 
understand how, as Richard Yarborough has. suggested, black writers sought, during the 
nineteenth century, to assert through fiction the potential of black people in America and, 
at the same time, to document and preserve their history.</p>

<p>As the older accounts of American fictional history left us asking, "Where were the 
blacks?" so they provoked the parallel question "Where were the women?" The work of 
critics like Elizabeth Ammons, Nina Baym, Hazel Carby, Cathy Davidson, Josephine 
Donovan, Judith Fetterley, Annette Koloday, Jane Tompkins, and Mary Helen Wash-
ington have begun to answer that question. It poses Stowe as  a key figure,3 in a sense a 
bridge between the earlier female writers both of realistic and romantic narratives– 
Susanna Rowson, Catharine Maria Sedgwick, Caroline Kirkland, Fanny Fern, Susan 
Warner, E. D. E. N. Southworth–and the next generation of realistic writers, women like 
Rebecca Harding Davis, Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, Rose Terry
Cooke, Sarah Orne Jewett, and Mary Wilkins Freeman. These authors turned neither east 
nor west but, at their finest, focused eyes keen for detail on the constricting material, and 
often dominantly female, worlds they inhabited in New England, New York, and the 
South. In turn, building consciously on the accomplishments of that previous generation, the
women 
writers of the early twentieth century–Chopin, Wharton, Mary Austin, Glasgow, Cather–
produced the most significant novels of the period by engaging the most burning 
questions of the time–at least for many white women–concerning social, political, and 
sexual equality for females.</p>

<p>In fact, an account of changing patterns of nineteenth-century women's–and some 
men's–fiction can be constructed around questions of gender, race, creativity, and power. 
The novelists of the earlier generation–the subjects of Nina Baym's Woman's Fiction–
wrote success tales, in which virtue, in the form of constancy, often self-denial, and 
sometimes devotion to craft generally brought happy endings for the heroines and those 
who, in effect, they had gathered around themselves. Alcott and Stowe continued to 
present domestic values as key to ethical life, to public virtue, and, in a story like Alcott's 
"Psyche's Art," to valid creation. Although women's and men's spheres are separate, the 
subordination of hearth to countinghouse has not yet, fictionally at least, taken place; 
indeed, Stowe offers both fictive and theoretical validations of the kitchen as value center. 
In Jacobs, while the form of self-denial is even more profound, both the meanings of 
"constancy and the happiness of the ending are made problematic by virtue of how 
American culture construes race. In Phelps, the contradictions between countinghouse and 
the sphere of women become harsher, for in The Silent Partner the women are excluded 
from the sources of economic power, and while Sip and Perley, the two heroines, continue 
to try to
 improve the lives of workers, it is not clear whether that project can reach beyond the 
consolations of Christian charity. In Phelps's later work, like The Story of Avis and Dr. 
Zay, the conflicts between domesticity and a woman's art or work heighten; such conflicts 
remain but are less central to the instructional program of Frances Ellen Watkins Harper's  
Iola Leroy. Jewett sustains the values of an elaborated, extended domestic sphere; indeed, 
The Country of the 
Pointed Firs emerges as a kind of mythic center of family strength, to which an urban 
inhabitant may travel for renewal, though she cannot stay. Freeman is even less optimistic, 
for while many of her women are strong and independent, they are so in a narrowing 
world, at its bleakest in a story like "Old Woman Magoun," but constricting even in the 
triumphant "The Revolt of'Mother."' The arc of this fictional history can thus be tracked, 
as it were, from the successes of Ruth Hall and Capitola in The Hidden Hand to the 
contrasting fates of the heroines in The Awakening and The House of Mirth.</p>

<p>Obviously, this account of fictional history is radically at variance with conventional 
versions. The differences arise, I want to suggest in a moment, from fundamentally 
divergent understandings of what was, and is, historically significant. But first we need to 
observe that such differing accounts of literary history are deeply embedded in critical 
terminology and historical categories. For example, the expression "regionalist" or "local 
colorist" continues to be applied to lewett, Freeman, Chopin, Paul Laurence Dunbar, 
Charles Chesnutt. I think that term marks them as peripheral to the development of a 
national culture, supposedly one of the major accomplishments of nineteenth-century 
American letters. But a critical category like "regionalism" is about as useful–and as 
accurate–in describing these writers as a phrase like "escapist fiction" would be if applied 
to Poe, Melville, and Twain.4 Categories like "regionalist"–and, I suspect, "ethnic" or 
even "minoriry"–encapsulate particular accounts of literary development; they 
also-embody judgments of the value of writers and works based on assumptions
about the importance of particular subjects and certain forms, as well as on differing 
conceptions of the functions of art and the role of artists.</p>

<p>A similar set of problems arises when we examine the use of a category like "realism." 
In our culture, the term and its cognates, including "realistic," imply positive, perhaps even 
weighty, judgments. The older account of white male fictional history that I sketched 
above suggested that realism somehow arose as a later nineteenth-century dialectical 
corrective to the romance or fantasy tradition self-consciously developed by Poe, 
Hawthorne, and Melville. In fact, however, literary historians have demonstrated that the 
roots of fictional realism can be found in earlier nineteenth-century women writers like 
Kirkland, Alice Cary, and Susan Warner (Fetterley; Tompkins; Donovan). Kirkland 
described her book  A New Home...Who'll Follow(1839) as a "rough picture . . . 
pentagraphed from the life," dealing with "common-place occurrences–mere gossip about 
every-day people." Fetterley points out that Kirkland specifically dissociated herself from 
the dominantly male tradition of adventure, mystery, and romance because she chose to 
tell the story of the frontier from the diurnal perspective of a woman plunged into its not 
very glamorous woods and fields–or, rather, its mudholes and hovels. Similarly, Alfred 
Habegger has traced some of the ways in which the dominantly female practice of realism 
in mid-nineteenth-century America shaped the fictional strategy of the later male writers 
that critics have traditionally described as "realists."</p>

<p>What is at stake here is not simply a revisionist claim to prior occupation of valued 
turf–however significant that might be. The stakes emerge if we begin from Toni 
Morrison's proposition that narrative is "the principal way in which human knowledge is 
made accessible." The issue is, then, what of human knowledge a particular set of 
narrative.–a canon or a historical construct–encodes, makes accessible–or obscures. In a 
certain sense, the effect if not the design of literary history is to make it seem self-evident 
that the kinds of problems worked out in the texts it considers constitute the universe of 
significant issues. The "territory ahead"–at least as it came to be defined as the grounds for 
the encounter of lone individuals with nature–was for clear material reasons far more of a 
presence in white male imagination during the middle and late nineteenth century–and for 
ideological reasons again in the 1920s. Before the Civil War, Horace Greeley's injunction 
to "Go west, young man" simply voiced what had become a commonplace of action 
among many men. With the decline of farming, fishing, and trade in much of New England 
after the war, with the increased mobility and entrepreneurial opportunities stimulated by 
the war, the railroads, and that westering ideology, many Yankee men struck out for new 
frontiers or imagined what it meant to do so. It would not therefore be surprising if images 
encoding that theme characterized the work of white male writers, like Poe, Melville, 
Twain, Harte, Crane, Norris, London, Richard Harding Davis–or reengaged the interests 
of male intellectuals, professors, and critics after the First World War, when a definition of 
a "masculine" role on the world stage for the United States was being created.</p>

<p>American Indians, like William Apes, Elias Boudinot, Black Hawk, shared a vision of 
the importance of the frontier, but in their experience it was often represented as the 
intrusion of the boots of a giant into the grounds of their hunt and the graves of their 
people. For antebellum black writers, the frontier was located as much at the Mason-
Dixon Line as anywhere else, and the perilous journey from slavery to selfhood the major 
concern. In time, to be sure, it became clear that the psychological boundaries
presented by color prejudice were more difficult to surmount than the geographical divide 
between North and South. In such contexts, individual confrontations with whales or wars 
were never central, for the issue was neither metaphysics nor nature but the social 
constructions called "prejudice," and the problem was not soluble by or for individuals 
(except the very few who could and wished to "pass"), but only through a process of 
social change.  </p>

<p>For women, the great question of life might be that addressed by Jewett in "Aunt 
Cynthy Dallett" or in "The Foreigner": that is, how to build and sustain a largely female 
community in the face of poverty, narrowness, even pride. Or it might be the problem, 
addressed by Freeman in "A Church Mouse" or "The Revolt of 'Mother,'" or, very 
differently, by Jacobs in Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, of how the weak achieve 
through disobedience a modicum of power. Such concerns after a half-century in which 
they were taken to be trivial, have, as I need hardly say, returned to prominence, and with 
them works that encode and interpret them. I don't want to belabor the obvious, but the 
canon is, after all, a construct, like a history text, expressing what a society reads back 
into the past as important to its future.</p>

<p>My intent is not to deny the significance of defining an isolated, heroic self against the 
forces of nature–a theme, as we all know, peculiarly persistent in the Romantic fictions of 
American white males that have constituted the received canon. That problem was, no 
doubt, of both real and symbolic consequence to American entrepreneurs well into the 
twentieth century. And the ideological manifestations of Romantic individualism remain 
so. But equally substantial and interesting are the social issues: the prices paid, often by 
women, for men's upward, or outward, mobility, the sacrifices of community to self, the 
difficulties of sustaining community. Moreover, the conceptions of self and the processes 
of definition as they emerge for Deerslayer, Ishmael, Huck, Nick Adams, Ike McCaslin 
differ sharply from those we encounter in the work of many minority writers, where the 
problematic of self consists more often of its emergence within conflicting definitions of 
community and continuity, as is the case in Zora Neale Hurston's There Eyes Were 
Watching God, Kingston's Woman Warrior, Rudolfo Anaya's Bless Me, Ultima, or John 
Joseph Mathews's Sundown.</p>

<p>What is at stake here can, I think, be apprehended in two related passages, the first 
from the introductory material of Leslie Marmon Silko's Ceremony, the second from 
Meridel Le Sueur's Girl:

You don't have anything
if you don't have the stories.
Their evil is mighty
but it can't stand up to our stories.
So they try to destroy the stories
let the stories be confused or forgotten.
They would like that
They would be happy
because we would be defenseless then. (2; 1978)


And from The Girl:

Memory is all we got, I cried, we got to remember. We got to remember everything. It is 
the glory, Amelia said, the glory. We got to remember to be able to fight. Got to write 
down the names. Make a list. Nobody can be forgotten.  They know if we don't remember 
we can't point them out. They got their guilt wiped out. The last thing they take is 
memory. (142)</p>

<p>From this perspective, what is involved in literary history is survival.5   If that seems 
an aggrandizement of what writers and critics do, consider at the simplest level the history 
in this century of words like Frederick Douglass's. Narrative, Rebecca Harding Davis's 
Life in the Iron Mills, or Charlotte Perkins Gilman's "The Yellow Wallpaper." In 19s5 they 
were virtually extinct as literary word.; they addressed concerns remote from those at the 
core of the cultural mainstream. That they are now enshrined in American literature 
anthologies testifies to the force exerted on literary history by political movements. 
Indeed, when I speak of "survival" here, I refer not so much to these works in themselves 
as to the knowledge they make accessible, the experiences to which they give expression 
and shape–experiences that enable new generations to
 comprehend themselves and their world.</p>

<p>What I have thus far said suggests a view of the function of art, indeed a functional 
perspective on art, perhaps uncongenial to those of us brought up on formalist paradigms. I 
wish now to turn directly to that concern, for it is indeed true that conceiving American 
literature as a comparative discipline implies some differing perspectives on what it is that 
literary works attempt to do in our world.</p>

III

<p>Like many minority writers, Charles Chesnutt was extraordinarily sensitive to 
questions of the functions of art as well as to the status of artists from marginalized 
groups. For many years, he was regarded as a local colorist, a writer of humorous dialect 
tales, and, because of his focus on the "tragic mulatto" in his supposedly more serious 
work, a writer central to neither black nor white fictional concerns. In The Conjure 
Woman, Chesnutt himself compares versions of the roles of a literary artist and poses a 
distinctive role for the African American writer. The narrator of that book is a liberal 
white Northerner, John, who has moved to North Carolina in part for the sake of his wife's 
health and in part to try his hand at making money through grape cultivation. Resident on 
the land John buys and deeply knowledgeable about it is Uncle Julius, an elderly 
black man, former slave, teller of tales, and sometime coachman for John and his wife, 
Annie. John views Julius with something of the well-meaning condescension of a turn-
of-the-century white literary critic toward a black artist. On the one hand, Julius's stories 
seem to while away the long southern hours, and in particular to distance Annie from the 
meaninglessness of her life. On the other hand, as John sees it, Julius's stories are a means 
by which the old man, generally by winning Annie's response, is able to extract from John 
a living or some kind of concession for himself or his relatives. For John, Julius's art is a 
kind of minstrelsy, an amusement for his hearers and a source of income, or at least 
livelihood, for himself. Serious art is the kind of novel John reads to
Annie–in the vain hope of rousing her from the depression into which she increasingly and
fearfully sinks as the book progresses.</p>

<p>In certain respects, the key story in the structure of The Conjure Woman is "Sis' 
Becky's Pickaninny," a tale in which the conjurer uses a hummingbird and a hornet, among 
other creatures, to reunite Sis' Becky with her child. and thus restore her to health. In the 
course of the narration, Annie–like Sis' Becky in Julius's tale–is moved from a threatening 
illness toward recovery. The vital ingredient in that cure is the magic of Julius' story, 
clearly presented by Chesnutt as parallel to the conjurer's magic in Julius's story and 
symbolized by the rabbit's foot Julius carries. To John, the rabbit's foot represents merely 
the superstition of a race barely emerging from primitive backwardness:

"Julius," I observed, half to him and half to my wife, "your people will never rise in the 
world until they throw off these childish superstitions and learn to live by the light of 
reason and common sense. How absurd to imagine that the forefoot of a poor dead rabbit, 
with which he timorously felt his way along through a life surrounded by snares and 
pitfalls, beset by enemies on every hand, can promote happiness or success, or ward off 
failure or misfortune!" (135)

Similarly, while John perceives the invigorating impact of Julius's tale upon Annie, he 
cannot understand the source of its power for her, much less the significance of the rabbit's 
foot itself.

My wife had listened to this story with greater interest than she had manifested in any 
subject for several days. I had watched her furtively from time to time during the recital, 
and had observed the play of her countenance. It had expressed in turn sympathy, indigna-
tion, pity, and at the end lively satisfaction.

"That is a very ingenious fairy tale, Julius," 1 said, "and we are much obliged to you."

"Why, John!" said my wife severely, "the story bears the stamp of truth, if ever a story 
did."

"Yes," I replied, "especially tbe humming-bird episode, and the mocking-bird digression, 
to say nothing of the doings of the hornet and the sparrow."

"Oh, well, I don't care," she rejoined, with delightful animation; "those are mere orna-
mental details and not all essential. The story is true to nature, and might have happened 
half a hundred times, and no doubt did happen, in those horrid days before the war."

"By the way, Julius," I remarked, "your story doesn't establish what you started out to 
prove,–that a rabbit's foot brings good luck."

"Hit's plain 'nuff ter me, suh," replied Julius. "I bet young missis dere kin 'splain it herse'f."

"I rather suspect," replied my wife promptly, "that Sis' Becky had no rabbit's foot."

"You is hit de bull's eye de fus' fire, ma'm," assented Julius. (158-s0)

</p><p>Annie responds to the feelings communicated by the tale, rather than to its "mere 
ornamental details"; in the same spirit, she accepts the rabbit's foot from Julius and 
proceeds in the book's
final story to make common cause with him–thus establishing, as it were, a community of 
feeling to which John is largely marginal. It seems clear to me that Chesnutt is proposing 
the conjurer/Uncle Julius as a model for the work of the African American creative artist. 6 
Yes, an entertainer, and yes, of necessity concerned
with survival, the artist is in this vision most fundamentally committed to creating health, 
and especially "right feeling" (to use Stowe's phrase) about race and history, in the 
audience through the magic of art.  "Right feeling" lies at the root of "right actions," and it 
is right actions in the world to which those who emphasize the social functions of art are 
committed.  The careers, as
well as the writings, of Chestnut's contemporaries Frances Harder and W.E.B.Du Bois 
embody similar conceptions of prose driven by the engine of social reform–though they 
were, of course,
more activists than Chesnutt.  This basic understanding of artistic function has, I think, 
been asserted, contested, transformed throughout the history of African American letters--
and of other minority communities as well.  Such ideas played a critical role in the Black 
Arts movement and in the emergence of Chicano and Puertorriqueno literature in the 
1960s.  They reemerge, as Alice Walker's "faith in the power of the written word to reach, 
to teach, to empower and encourage–to change and save lives." (New York Times Book 
Review)<!-- p-->

</p><p>My point here is less to argue the validity of such conceptions of the social function of 
the writer than to pose them against the more generally accepted view of artistic 
achievement, and to suggest the implications of this distinction for the development of 
aesthetic theory and artistic premise among marginalized writers in the United States. In 
"The Art of Fiction," published just as Chesnutt began to reach his stride as a writer, 
Henry James states s succinctly as anyone has a contrasting view of art–especially of 
fiction, but of painting and history quite as well.  James's fundamental assertion is that 
fiction, like history, is an attempt "to represent and illustrate the past, the actions of men . ."
He has little patience with a moral view of the purpose of fiction.  "What is the meaning," he asks,

of your mortality and your conscious moral purpose? Will you not define your terms and 
explain
how (a novel being a picture) a picture can be either moral or immoral? You wish to paint 
a moral picture or carve a moral statue:  will you not tell us how you would set about it?  
We are discussing the Art of Fiction; questions of art are questions (in the widest sense) of 
execution; questions of morality are quite another affair, and will you not let us see how it 
is that you find it so easy to mix them up? (94-95)

Chesnutt had some answers to James's questions.  In an often-cited passage in his journal, 
he posed the aspirations he has set for himself as a literary artist:

The object of my writings would not be so much the elevation of the colored people as the 
elevation of the white--or I consider the unjust spirit of caste which is so insidious as to 
pervade a whole nation, and so powerful as to subject a whole race and all connected with 
it to scorn and social ostracism--consider this a barrier to the moral progress of the 
American people; and I would be one of the first to head a determined, organized crusade 
against it. Not a fierce indiscriminate onset, not an appeal to force, for this is something 
that force can but slightly affect, but a moral revolution which must be brought about in a 
different manner....</p>

<p>This work is of a two-fold character.  The negro's part is to prepare himself for 
recognition and equality, and it is the province of literature to open the way for him to get 
it–to accustom the public mind to the idea; to lead people on, imperceptibly, 
unconsciously, step by step, to the desired state of feeling.  If I can do anything to further 
this work, and can see any likelihood of obtaining success in it, I would gladly devote my 
life to it.(8)


Chesnutt sustained this sense of vocation--together with the desire to become rich and 
famous by writing--throughout his career, even as he perforce observed the failure of prose 
to contain the rising tide of turn-of-the-century racism.</p>

<p>It should come as no surprise that from the perspective of minority or marginalized 
groups, art should have a more clearly social, perhaps utilitarian, function. In one of his 
letters Bartolomeo Vanzetti writes, "[O]ur friends must speak loudly to be heard by our 
murderers, our enemies have only to whisper or even be silent to be understood" (Sacco 
and Vanzetti 277). Vanzetti is explaining how the imbalance of social and political power 
requires demonstrative behavior if a group of Italian anarchists is ever to be noticed, much 
less responded to, in Yankee New England, but what he says is suggestive about 
marginality more generally. The struggle for survival, for space and hope, commands all 
the limited resources available to a marginalized people. Art cannot stand outside that 
struggle; on the contrary, it must play an important role in it.7</p>

<p>It will be instructive in elaborating a comparative study of literary culture to examine 
how art has functioned in the sustenance of marginalized communities.  In "Poetry of the 
Colorado Miners, 1903-190s," Dan Tannacito has, for example, examined the role of 
poetry and song in the organization of western miners during the early years of this 
century. In Black Culture and Black Consciousness Lawrence Levine discusses the varied 
ways in which song has been used in black communities during and after slavery. A 
different set of instances is provided by the development in the 1960s of newspapers like  
El Malcriado and El Grito del Norte, of El Teatro Campesino, and of a variety of other 
community-based institutions of Chicano culture. Commenting on the poetry published in 
El Malcriado, Tomas Ybarra-Frausto has written that its primary "function was to sustain 
the spirit of struggle while simultaneously evoking aesthetic response" (85). Similarly, Luis 
Valdez, the founder of El Teatro Campesino, saw specifically social functions for the work 
of the troupe. The Actos, he wrote, "(1) inspire the audience to social action, (2) 
illuminate specific points about social problems, (3) show or hint at a solution, and (4) 
express what people are thinking" (qtd. by Ybarra-Frausto from Actos 87). Cultural 
activity thus becomes part of a process for transforming people from passive suffering into 
activists in struggle.</p>

<p>This is, however, only one of the roles art may play in a community.  Artistic function 
must be considered within a historical context, as well as in terms of the specific audience 
to which a work is directed.  I shall have more to say about audience later. As to history, it 
is plain that if art performs social functions, those functions may change as a society or a 
community within it changes. One need only lay side by side Wigglesworth's "Day of 
Doom," Whitman's "Song of Myself," and Eliot's "Wasteland" to observe profound 
alterations in poetic function–as well, of course, as in form. One cannot, then, simply say 
that "art functions in thus and such a fashion for minority communities." One needs, 
rather, to say that in certain periods art may help unite and stir a people; in others it may 
express sustaining beliefs; in still others it may help arouse the awareness of those outside 
a group; in yet others it may come to be a mode primarily of individual expression and 
self-actualization. In some periods art may serve all these purposes. My point, then, is the 
need to be aware not only of the varieties of artistic function but of its changing character 
over time.</p>

<p>In a certain sense, the issue posed between Chesnutt and Valdez, on the one hand, and 
James, on the other, is less a conflict over hostile theories of art than a difference over 
what one looks at in the process of creating and experiencing art. James focuses
attention on the polishing of technique, the shaping of the forms by which a work achieves 
the "solidity of specification" he regards as the truest measure of artistic achievement. 
Lying behind his point of view is the assumption that artists are people much like himself 
and that they address people much like himself, that art emerges from fineness of 
sensibility and intelligence and helps hone a like refinement in its audience. The poets and 
painters of the ethnic cultural movements of the 1960s and 1970s, like their predecessors, 
were by no means indifferent to form; on the contrary, in meetings and in print they 
discussed formal issues, the elaboration of technique, and the need to balance the demands 
of social activism and those of aesthetic excellence. But the primary concern was, in the 
first instance, how the creation of art helps its creators emerge from passivity and 
indifference before the world–and then, on the other ride of the creative work, so to 
speak, the impact of the work on the consciousness of those who experience it. Creator 
and audience--James speaks little of them except to urge the young novelist to "catch the 
color of life," and to shrug, regarding the reader, that there's no disputing taste. But for 
most people, and especially those from poor and minority communities, art cannot be 
contemplated, as it were, only from within.8</p>

<p>From another point of view, however, we are facing quite distinct artistic theories. 
That becomes clear when we realize that the usual standards of aesthetic merit are, as 
James proposes, the form and language of a text. "Truth of detail," James says, "the air of 
reality (solidity of specification)" constitute "the supreme virtue of a novel–the merit on 
which all its other merits (including that conscious moral purpose of which Mr. Besant 
speaks) helplessly and submissively depend.... The cultivation of this success, the study of 
this exquisite process, form, to my taste, the beginning and the end of the art of the 
novelist" (85).9

"To what end," Chesnutt might have responded, "should a writer 'catch the color . . . the 
substance of the human spectacle'? Is not merit determined by the capacity of a work to 
engage genuine feelings and thus to open us to others' lives, and worlds, and needs? Even 
to prod us to action in the world?"

With that idea, James would show little patience. Speaking in what emerges as his own 
voice, he writes:

I needn't remind you that there are all sorts of tastes:  who can know it better? Some 
people, for excellent reasons, don't like to read about carpenters; others, for reasons even 
better, don't like to read about courtesans.  Many object to Americans. Others (I believe 
they are mainly editors and publishers) won't look at Italians.... [Readers] choose their 
novels accordingly, and if they don't care about your idea they won't, a fortiori, care about 
your treatment.</p>

<p>So that it comes back very quickly, as I have said, to the liking:  in spite of M. Zola . . 
. who will not reconcile himself to this abso1uteness of taste, thinking that there are 
certain things that people ought to like, and that they can be made to like.... Selection will 
be sure to take care of itself, for it has a constant motive behind it. That motive is simply 
experience. As people feel life, so they will feel the art that is most closely related to it. 
(89-90)

James speaks with the ease of one whose subjects, at least many of them, will suit the 
interest and taste, will register the experience of his audience. But that presumption is not 
universally shared. The artist from a marginal group can by no means rely on
readers feeling the life that throbs in the world of the carpenter or the Italian. Indeed, the 
very first battle this artist must fight is precisely that defined by Zola: making readers like 
or, more to the point, find interest in, matters and people quite outside their 
experience.l0</p>

<p>There are different ways in which you can respond to the perception that your audi-
ence may find your subject not to its taste:  you can try to persuade your reader, by 
novelty, expostulation, or seduction, to take an interest in the case; you can set fresh 
banners snapping in the wind; you can extend a calming hand, leading quietly down the 
unfamiliar, rutted path. It may all come to nothing. Your choice may be to settle upon a 
circle of devotees, running the risk of becoming merely  precious to them–and yourself.  
Or you may lapse, in Tillie Olsen's apt word, into "silences."</p>

<p>The question of function is thus critically related, on the one hand, to subject and, on 
the other, to audience. The emphasis on form, which has dominated criticism and teaching 
since the 1920s, obscures these connections. Formalist critics concentrate on tracing the 
lineaments and dimensions of a book's structure, and they judge a work as a more or less 
fully realized aesthetic object, as a picture that "renders the look of things" James 85), a 
world in itself. The alternative we have been tracing asks whether the work acts effectively 
In the world, of which it and we constitute parts, by touching human feeling and shaping 
consciousness. Recent reader-response criticism has, once again, begun to examine the 
experience of literature in terms of its power to influence consciousness and shape 
concepts of self (see, e.g., Alcorn and Bracher). It seems to me likely that such a trend will 
be enhanced by the need to reconstruct the role of criticism implicit in a comparative 
approach to the literatures of the United States.</p>

<p>In thus balancing the emphasis on form and structure with a concern for subject, 
feeling, audience, and impact, I would not wish to be taken as suggesting an indifference 
to form on the part of marginalized writers. On the contrary, as I wish now to propose, 
formal questions are critical to a comparative study. At issue are the forms and structures 
organic to the work of marginalized writers and the way elements may differ from those in 
the literary tradition represented by Henry James and his successors. </p>

IV

<p>Few elements of human creativity are as hierarchically organized as presentational lan-
guage. We have, implicitly or explicitly, a Received Standard form of speech and dialects, 
which mark lower class or provinciality. Certain languages--French, for example–have 
carried more status for English speakers than others--Spanish, for example. In prosody, we 
value complexity, ambiguity, irony over simplicity, directness, transparency; written, fixed 
forms over oral, improvisational; the formal genres we call "fine arts" over the "practical" 
we call "crafts" or "fragmentary genres," like letters.  Thus we learn to place epic poetry at 
the apogee of forms. Below it, ranging down a great chain of types, we find dramatic and 
lyric poetry, the novel, short fiction; and then, as if crossing into suspect territory, genres 
like autobiography, journals, letters, transcriptions. The status of genres in some degree 
informs the status of their profession. In the study of marginalized literatures, however, we 
need to reexamine--even suspend--our assumptions about formal hierarchy and concentrate 
on discovering the formal conventions that emerge from those literatures themselves rather than
from our training as literary practitioners. </p>

<p>Conventions of composition and language are, after all, largely culture-specific as well 
as hierarchic. One of the most persistent and dominant patterns in English poetry, for 
example, is the iambic pentameter line, which may be rooted in stress patterns in the 
declarative sentence characteristic of Received Standard English. Poetic structures built on 
this iambic line, like blank verse and the sonnet, exercise a compelling influence on writers, 
perhaps because authors simply learn to use patterns they hear, read, and study. By 
contrast, West African-based cultures, including those of black Americans, reflect the 
importance of a call-and-response pattern of verse construction--as in work songs, the 
blues, and many hymns. Similarly, code switching (the shifting within a line or sentence 
from English to Spanish, or the reverse) is important in some Chicano and Puerto Rican 
poetry–as it can be in street-corner conversation, verbal play, and the creole called 
Spanglish. Likewise, repetitive forms are vital in American Indian chants and in many 
poems. Further, the rhythms of black folk English differ from those of Received Standard; 
obviously, the cadences of non-English primary speakers differ still more.</p>

<p>This is by no means to say that African-American writers invariably display the 
influence of call-and-response patterns, that bilingual poets inevitably switch codes, and 
that Indian writers must use repetitive forms. No more do they necessarily use folk speech 
or remain free of the influence of forms like the sonnet. On the contrary, the pulls of 
traditional English forms and upper-class white standards of speech have been very strong 
on minority writers, perhaps because such forms implicitly embody the English tradition 
they often wish to possess. Indeed, the history of each minority culture shows a period in 
which the artists are influenced deeply by the practice of earlier generations of British or 
British-actuated authors. Thus most American Indian and African American poetry of the 
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries imitates Scott, Byron, and Longfellow to excess, 
and the early black novel sometimes shows the stifling hand of sentimental fictional 
conventions.</p>

<p>Differences in formal conventions come into particular prominence when we confront 
those derived from oral and from written traditions. Written literary traditions tend to 
impose a sacredness on texts that, in turn, Produces two primary techniques of literary 
study: historical and textual analysis, designed initially to establish "true" texts, and 
explication de texte, designed to tease out its many potential meanings. Underlying this 
view of the sanctity of the written text is a romantic understanding of a literary work as 
the artist's private product, emerging from the power of his or her genius to express in a 
distinctive voice responses to a uniquely experienced world. The function of literary study, 
from this perspective, is to focus the reader's attention on the literary work itself because 
of its inherent value as an aesthetic structure. Further, change within the framework of a 
written literary culture is often wrenching and violent, as if the new poet had to explode 
out of the gravity pull of established conventions. Pound's injunction to "make it new" was 
only, as it were, a codification of what American predecessors like Whitman and 
Dickinson had practiced, but their difficulties in establishing the value of what they 
created illustrate my point. Further, the "anxiety of influence" about which Harold Bloom 
has written may well be a distinctive feature only of dominant written traditions.</p>

<p>By contrast, oral traditions are less obsessed with the sacredness of a text, more with
its functions, sometimes including its sacred functions, sometimes its functions in sus-
taining popular resistance to ideological domination. The precise reproduction of a song, 
poem, or story is probably of less moment than, on the one hand, the maintenance of its 
basic qualities and, on the other, its vivid re-creation in a new context for a new time and a 
new need. Improvisation is a major virtue of oral tradition, but it is important to recognize 
that improvisation is based on known and shared materials. Pound's sense of "make it 
new"--that is, dispensing with what exists and evoking wholly different texts from differing 
materials--would probably offend people whose culture is distinctly oral. In Mules and 
Men a woman in one of Zora Neale Hurston's "lieing" contests tells a story to explain why 
Negroes are black. One of the men, offended by her success, accuses her of inventing the 
"lie": "'Tain't no such story nowhere. She jus' made dat one up herself." Her friend 
responds, "Naw, she didn't. I been knowin' dat ole tale"--that is, the story is well 
established, traditional, and therefore worthy of repeating and staking a claim to.12  Oral 
forms also depend on apparent simplicity of structure; on oral-formulaic devices, including 
repetition of words, phrases, and lines; often on certain stock characters, situations, 
phrases well known to the original audience. These qualities obviously suggest the needs of 
performance and of reception by a listening audience, but they are at least in some respects 
carried over into written genres that continue to reflect oral traditions.</p>

<p>It would be a mistake, however, to suppose that the problem with which we are 
dealing concerns simply the difference between established written and oral cultures. In 
the first place, virtually all ethnic and minority literatures in the United States are by now 
in written form. But more to the point: all written cultures represent the transformation 
and codification of earlier oral cultures; once writing is developed among a people, oral 
cultures gradually unfold themselves into written form. That is as true of the traditions of 
British literature as it is of Navajo. Thus, as Ann Fitzgerald has suggested to me, what we 
are comparing are cultures at different stages in the process of transformation from oral to 
written. Part of the difference is simply chronological: writing came to Britain twelve to 
fifteen hundred years ago, but to American Indian tribes as well as to most African-
Americans, within the last century. But perhaps more important, the processes through 
which oral forms, pass into written forms differ substantially from culture to culture. They 
invariably involve performance, but the concept of performance that informs 
Shakespearean drama--still close to British oral traditions--is far different from that which 
underlies Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God or N. Scott Momaday's Way to Rainy 
Mountain. The medieval trope and the Elizabethan stage may be cousins, but distant ones, 
of the AME testimony and preaching and the street-corner theatrics Hurston displays in 
Mules and Men. And these, in turn, only remotely resemble the ceremonies and myths that 
inform Momaday's narrative.</p>

<p>Still, it is instructive to remember that Shakespeare composed at the nether end of a 
process of oral-to-written transformation. In their brawling, topical quality, their 
changeableness from performance to performance, their dependence on traditional subjects 
and themes, their function in reinforcing recently established social and political norms, in 
the manner in which their language forever plays against the edges of meaning, his dramas 
reflect how open they were to the still generative orality of British common culture. These 
are, many of them, qualities we might expect--indeed will
find--in works with which we are concerned here, like those of Hurston, for example, or 
Morrison and John Wideman. Such writers use, of course, today's most popular genre, the 
novel, which offers a different set of opportunities and constraints from Elizabethan 
drama. Within that genre, however, they self-consciously strive to sustain a voice, at once 
elevated and commonplace, serious and linguistically playful. As in oral cultures, success 
in verbal play confirms artistic power, serves to provide a certain breathing space within 
the dense and often dark fabric of plot, and registers a kind of ascendancy in the 
continuing struggle of marginalized cultures to emerge from the shadows. But there is a 
cost to what Wideman calls "bi-lingual fluency"; he writes in "The Black Writer and the 
Magic of the Word":

Afro-Americans must communicate in a written language which in varying degrees is 
foreign to our oral traditions. You learn the language of power, learn it well enough to 
read and write but its forms and logic cut you off, separate you from the primal 
authenticity of your experience, experience whose meaning resides in the first language 
you speak, the language not only of words but gestures, movements, rules of silence and 
expressive possibilities, of facial and tactile understanding, a language of immediate, 
sensual, intimate reciprocity, of communal and self-definition. (28)</p>

<p>In studying texts still tuned to oral cadences, we need to bring back into question 
some generally unexamined critical assumptions and touchstones. One of these is the idea 
that a literary work should, so far as possible, be complete in itself, should not have to 
depend for fulfillment of its intentions on knowledge, ideas, images that the text does not 
provide. The best fiction, Henry James proposes, "renders" (85) the world it pictures; it is 
not up to the reader to supply what the text omits. But in many traditional cultures--those 
of American Indians, for example--the audience for a tale or ritual presentation would a 
priori be familiar with characters or situations. It would be superfluous, indeed 
meaningless, for the artists to introduce, describe, and elaborate on what is known and 
shared, like Coyote and his machinations or the role of the storyteller. Indeed, works like 
Leslie Marmon Silko's "Storyteller" or "Yellow Woman" vibrate with echoes of such 
traditional figures. Thus a tale may not be "complete" precisely because the expectation is 
that the audience will bring to it whatever is left unstated. In fact, when we look closely, 
we find that the notion of a work of art as self-contained, complete in itself, is a chimera. 
Any art work plays upon, sometimes against, the expectations, the patterns of knowledge, 
the assumptions about form and content--not to speak of the conventions of language--an 
audience brings to it. Thus, whether we are talking about a Henry James novel or a 
Harlequin romance, the issue is not in this respect whether a work is "fully realized" or 
not, but what it anticipates an audience will bring to it and what purposes are served by 
thus depending on what the reader furnishes for the book. That leads to a new set of 
questions--such as, for example, whether Ellison in Invisible Man draws on certain folk 
traditions of the trickster to differentiate the responses of black and white readers to 
scenes like those involving Clifton, whether there are in effect "inside" and "outside" 
readings of his book.</p>

<p>A second set of issues involves how we evaluate texture. As critics of written litera-
ture, we have largely ascribed value to organic complexity in structure, ambiguity, and 
tension in language--each line crafted new, each situation fresh. In "The Metaphysical 
Poets" T. S. Eliot argues that "poets in our civilization, as it exists at present, must be 
difficult... The poet must become more and more comprehensive, more allusive, more 
indirect, in order to force, to dislocate if necessary, language into his meaning" (248). 
Reading such preferences back into the past, Eliot and his successors extolled the virtues 
of the metaphysical poets; suiting practice to theory (or, perhaps, vice versa), they 
developed the complex modernist style exemplified by The Four Quartets,
Pound's Cantos, or Hart Crane's "Bridge."</p>

<p>I would not deny the virtues of complex poetic structures, or of the dense, allusive 
modernist line–in their place. But these are not the only virtues in poetry, nor are they the 
only means for representing the modern world, much less "our civilization." Indeed, the 
phrase "our civilization" is itself problematic. Obviously, not all inhabitants of a given 
space participate in what is defined as "civilization" or, for that matter, have real access to 
its privileges. "Complexity" in language can be, in fact, a mask for privilege, a screen 
behind which power sustains itself--in criticism as in poetry. Gwendolyn Brooks had no 
need for obscurity of language when she sent her poetic sensibility to observe the 
ordinariness of hate in Little Rock. What image better catches our "civilization" than 
Langston Hughes's ordinary "raisin in the sun"? Indirection is not at a premium when Judy 
Grahn writes of the "common woman," or Susan Griffin thinks of Harriet Tubman and the 
problem of feeding children, or Denise Levertov writes of what the Vietnamese were like. 
To what extent is the manner in which one uses language dependent upon where one is 
placed in "our" civilization, or upon one's audience, one's conception of the functions of 
art?</p>

<p>An artist's outlook on the culture underlies the conventions he or she adopts. Eliot 
saw his civilization in decline and from its shards and fragments erected a Great Allusive 
Wall against the impending ruin. In a sense his poems, like Pound's, constitute certain 
kinds of humanities curricula, "The Rise and Decline of Christian Civilization." That may 
help to explain the great popularity of their poetry with an earlier generation of academics, 
as well as the faintly musty quality some of today's critics detect. But there are other 
assumptions about American culture and thus other ways even of "assembling fragments 
of experience" from the past--indeed, other conceptions of the fragments suitable for 
preservation.  In studying "women's work" like quilts and blankets, Shiela de Brettville has 
proposed that their "assemblage of fragments pieced together whenever there is time" has 
often been organized into a "complex matrix [that] suggests depth and intensity as an 
alternative to progress" (117-18). Vera Norwood has examined the efforts of a number of 
southwestern women artists to utilize in their contemporary work fragments of the 
ordinary lives of their foremothers--stitching, pieces of lace, botanical drawings, snatches 
of letters, diaries, conversation.  Rolando Hinojosa's Klail City Death Trip series assembles 
fragments of imagined south Texas experience, often widely separated in time--newspaper 
reports, diary entries, narrative accounts--precisely to contest the definition of what 
constitutes "our civilization" and who will have power within it. Similarly, books as 
diverse as Momaday's Way to Rainy Mountain, Anaya's Bless Me, Ultima
and Kingston's Woman Warrior are, among other things, efforts to preserve as well as to 
utilize anew elements of their diverse cultural traditions.</p>

<p>I am not proposing that works by marginalized writers are necessarily simple in 
language or in structure, or that they inevitably ignore Euro-American traditions. On the 
contrary, books like Morrison's Sula, Walker's Meridian, and Silko's Ceremony
and, indeed, Invisible Man–are structurally rich, and there are dozens of minority poets 
whose language and imagery operate fully within the modernist mode. Still, we
need to understand certain artifacts of critical response:  for example, Thomas Pynchon 
has published three novels, and there are at least a dozen books and untold articles out 
explaining them. About the group of black women novelists–Gwendolyn Brooks, Paule 
Marshall, Toni Morrison, Toni Cade Bambara, Alice Walker, Gayl Jones, Gloria Naylor–
writing perhaps the most compelling fiction today, there are few works (Christian, Black 
Women Novelists and Black Fcminist Criticism; Evans, Black Women Writers; Pryse and 
Spillers, Conjuring). To be sure, some of the work of these writers is more recent, and the 
disproportion will no doubt change over time. But to an extent, as critics we have been 
taught and have learned to "valorize" the pleasures of the epistemological games 
constructed by writers like Pynchon, Nabokov, and Barth. Let us leave apart the question 
of whether promoting the virtues of complexity, denseness, and even obscurity, and 
maintaining an outlook of genteel pessimism, are in some degree functions of sustaining 
the roles--and jobs--of literary interpreters. We still need to ask whether the expectation, 
the demand for denseness and speculative play in a work does not disable critics from 
apprehending other virtues, of transparency in structure, of immediacy in language, of 
feelings deeply engaged by symbol.</p>

<p>Further, few minority writers can evade the tension imposed by the implicit demand 
that they appeal to quite differing language and cultural communities. A writer for the 
New York Review of Books can, perhaps, sneer at oral traditions in literature, but minor-
ity writers do so, or otherwise detach themselves from the linguistic contexts of their own 
communities, at peril of drying up the sources of creativity and also validation. Art works 
can be ranged along a wide spectrum, from those that are most dense, elaborated, to those 
that are most transparent, straightforward. It seems to me that writers from marginalized 
groups make use of more bands on this spectrum than those whose reference group is in 
significant measure academic intellectuals.  In reading work produced by writers from 
marginalized groups, in developing a comparative approach to American literature, we 
must ourselves widen our perception and appreciation of formal features often different 
from those we have been trained to acknowledge.</p>

<p>We are only at the beginning of understanding and explaining the pervasive influence 
of non-European traditions in the forms and conventions developed by minority writers. A 
number of critics, most notably Sherley Williams and Houston Baker, have examined the 
interaction of song styles like the blues with the more formal productions of black writers.  
More recently, the understanding of the impact of call-and-response patterns has been 
extended to fiction. In "Untroubled Voice" Barbara E. Bowen has convincingly analyzed 
the structure and development of Jean Toomer's Cane in such terms, arguing that the work 
is most succesfull "when Toomer opens up for us what it means to turn the 
call-and-response pattern into a literary form."</p>

<p>Similarly, the subject and aims of Silko's novel Ceremony emerge from patterns of 
repetition with variation. The story of its hero, Tayo, reproduces, albeit with the 
differences necessary to new times and the remixing of cultures, the "mythic" purification 
ceremony carried forward by Hummingbird and Fly on behalf of the people, who have 
strayed after strange and dangerous magic. The language of the mythic and traditional and 
of poet-Second World War ceremonies interpenetrates, especially in seemingly casual 
phrases--like "it wasn't easy," "it won't be easy," "it isn't easy"-- which migrate from the 
mythic passages of the novel into descriptions of the experiences of Tayo and his aunt. 
What we discover with Tayo is the commonality of that experience, through time:

The anticipation of what he might find was strung tight in his belly; suddenly the tension 
snapped and hurled him into the empty room where the ticking of the clock behind the 
curtains had ceased. He stopped the mare. The silence was inside, in his belly; there was 
no longer any hurry. The ride into the mountain had branched into all directions of time. 
He knew then why the oldtimers could only speak of yesterday and tomorrow in terms of 
the present moment the only certainty; and this present tense of being was qualified with 
bare hints of yesterday or tomorrow, by saying, "I go up to the mountain tomorrow." The 
ck'o'yo Kaup'a'ta somewhere is stacking his gambling sticks and waiting for a visitor; 
Rocky and I are walking across the ridge in the moonlight; Josiah and Robert are waiting 
for us. This night is a single night; and there has never been any other. (201)</p>

<p>  The book's heuristic objective repeats that of the traditional storyteller: "to fight off / 
illness and death" (2) by regenerating awareness of pattern and order through the language 
of ceremonies (cf. Toelken and Scott 88). Repetition, to say it another way, is here not 
merely a convention of composition but the fundamental principle of psychological and 
social order, and the book takes on ever-deeper echoes for those familiar with the 
repetitive patterns of traditional Indian narratives. Thus traditional forms become in more 
than a metaphorical sense the 1ifeblood of minority artists.</p>

<p>But the problem of identifying and validating differing forms and conventions extends 
to the work of white women as well. Elizabeth Ammons, for example, her contrasted the 
organizing principles of Jewett's Country of the Pointer Firs, with the "hierarchical mode" 
of conventional narrative as created by men. Jewett does not use a linear structure, with its 
built-toward climax coming near the end, but rather what Ammons describes as a 
"webbed, net-worked" organization, in which the "most highly charged experience of the 
book . . . comes at the center (85, 89). Further, Ammons argues, "psychically, the 
aggregative structure of Jewett's narrative reproduces female relational reality" in the 
process of constructing a female-oriented community. I do not wish here to enter the 
vexed and problematic issue of the existence of a distinctly female structure or style. What 
might help illuminate Jewett could obscure her contemporary, Freeman, for she organizes 
her stories along much more traditional patterns of creating and quickly resolving conflict, 
even though the concerns of women, mostly poor, are at the center of almost all of the 
stories. My point is narrower: critics have often asked of Jewett's stories questions drawn 
from other literary contexts and have thus missed the distinctive organizational strategy 
with which Jewett was working. Thus she was portrayed as engaging despite her 
presumed formal shortcomings, rather than seen as important because of her formal 
innovations.</p>

<p>The issue here is not only differences in the forms and conventions marginalized 
writers use but the uses to which they put traditional conventions. Point of view is a 
technical device often employed by Henry James, for example--to produce psychological 
verisimilitude and intimacy of narrative; Chesnutt uses it in "The Passing of Grandison," 
however, to raise political consciousness. The story is told from the point of view of a 
white character in it, which necessarily places the predominantly white readership of the 
story outside the head and experiences of the black slave, Grandison. The story seems to 
be constructed to produce an O. Henry-style surprise ending, in which the slave masters 
initially
celebrate Grandison's unexpected return from Canada. But the ending is less a surprise 
than a political lesson, for, like the whites in the tale, readers tend to impose their versions 
of reality on events. Grandison has his own, which
emerges only at the story's conclusion, when we find that he had returned only long 
enough to spirit his whole family off to freedom. If that ending is a surprise–and in the 
classroom I have found that it almost always is, even for black students,–it confirms that 
the audience knows as little of Grandison as his slave master, a matter for some 
embarrassed reflection.  "The Passing of Grandison" uses the device of point of view and 
the conventions of the "puttin' on ol' massa" tale to pursue certain social objectives.  Alice 
Walker's Meridian offers a more complex instance of how point of view and gliding time 
frames are used to move readers from detached amusement to informed malaise, and to 
point outward from the fiction to the world it encourages us to transform. Thus a 
reconception of forms entails a comparable rethinking of function.</p>

<p>Formal analysis is, and is likely to remain, the meat and potatoes of the literary 
profession, at least in the classroom. A comparativist strategy compels us to appreciate a 
broader range of conventions, to set form more fully into historical and functional context, 
and to comprehend how audience expectation and assumption mandate formal priorities. 
It is to this last problem, audience, that I now wish briefly to turn.</p>

V

  <p>Twenty-five years ago, audience was seldom a problematic in literary study. To be 
sure, it was important for historians of the drama and for medievalists to establish what 
kinds of people saw or participated in a performance. And the starting point for work like 
Ian Watt's on the development of the novel was the recognition of its primarily bourgeois 
audience. But on the whole, and certainly in the classroom, the responding reader was 
conceived to be as universal as the work itself.  The wide differences in background, 
assumption, and perception among readers are now a commonplace of literary instruction–
or at least of comment about literature, for it is not at all clear how the commonplace 
translates into changed classroom practise.  However that might be, a new style of literary 
criticism emerged in the 1980s, focused on the implications of reader response to texts.  
While this criticism may have had its origins in psycholinguistic concerns, it seems to me 
to have evolved precisely because it registers a central reality that is also vital to the 
comparative study of American literatures: the diversity of audience response to literature 
in late twentieth-century America.</p>

<p>That diversity, as I have suggested elsewhere in this paper, arises from the disparity in 
cultural histories and needs of the heterogeneous population of this country. Increasingly 
since the 1970s, that heterogeneity has been reflected in college and university classrooms 
and, in some degree, in changing American literature curricula (see Lauter, 
Reconstructing). Most instructors, however, continue to regard the classroom as a neutral 
ground for literary study, within which differing works can, whatever the context of their 
original articulation, be studied with equal success and without a great deal of attention to 
differences among students apart from the levels of their literacy. In fact, however, the 
classroom is hardly neutral territary for literary study, since its character privileges certain 
kinds of texts–particularly those that offer rich and ambiguous possibilities for 
interpretation–and strips others of their functional qualities–like those that are pans of 
rituals and performances, or those with heavily defined historical missions and contexts. 
Equally to our point here: while it would be foolish to deny the literary handicaps many of 
our students face, it would be equally dangerous not to see
that they have substantially different cultural outlooks and diverse expectations–however 
unarticulated–about art.  To say this another way: the recognition of how audiences for art 
differ in assumptions and desires has been pressed upon-many literary practitioners by the 
fact of classroom diversity.</p>

<p>In confronting audience diversity, teachers and critics of literature are in a sense 
departing down a road long traveled by marginalized writers. Both for practical and for 
ideological reasons, minority writers have, since the earliest colonies, had to contend 
with–even if they finally chose to ignore–disparities between readers from the majority 
culture and those from their own cultures. Until the turn of the twentieth century, and 
probably into the 1920s, few minority writers–mainly journalists and pamphleteers–could 
afford to confine themselves to readers from their own group. Black readership, for 
example, was too limited to provide practical vocations for artists like Chesnutt, Dunbar 
(who turned to musical theater), Frances Harper (who earned a living as organizer and 
educator), or even Pauline Hopkins, though she published with a black-run press.  Only in 
the 1920s, with the increasing concentration, in northern urban centers, of blacks who 
were at least modestly affluent, and with the self-conscious efforts of men like Charles S. 
Johnson to interest white publishers in black writers, was it possible for black authors to 
begin to depend on–and thus be able to speak primarily to–a black constituency. Further, 
earlier black writers–as we have seen in the case of Chesnutt–wished to address a white 
audience as part of a campaign to establish the personhood of blacks in white 
consciousness. Thus, in some sense like s1ang or other verbal games, writing both 
revealed to and hid from the majority audience qualities of the minority writer's society 
and experience. As a spiritual might signal "happy darkies" to whites and "prepare for 
flight" to blacks, so a poem or play could figure both play and rage.</p>

<p>Such generalizations do not, of course, hold for American Indian tribal art forms, 
whose audiences were groups within the tribe and which, indeed, varied in performance 
depending upon audience factors–like the age and sex of listeners. Nor are such gener-
alizations applicable to Mexican American writing in the nineteenth and early twentieth 
centuries. Many authors writing in Spanish in the southwestern United States had their 
work printed in Spanish-language newspapers whose constituencies identified themselves 
as Mexican, or at least as "borderers." For such authors, of course, the tensions of 
addressing a dual audience did not exist, or duality emerged as a function of subject, and 
perhaps of style. It is thus clearly the case that, in regard to audience, the evolutions of 
minority literatures are even more different one from another than in other respects and 
that generalizations are here even more fragile than elsewhere. For minority writers, the 
major problem of audience appears–at least after some degree of literacy obtains within 
the group–whenever they choose to speak to those outside the group. But at what point 
historically that choice becomes important–and, indeed, at what point it seems again to be 
irrelevant–differs from group to group.</p>

<p>These considerations also apply to the history of white women and white men writers 
in the United States, though the problems that emerge are clearly distinct. For men like 
Hawthorne and Melville, as is well known, the difficulty was that many of their potential 
readers were female and thus, in certain ways like minority writers, they had to address an 
audience whose culture and expectations partly differed from their own. The resulting 
tensions seem to have been the source of considerable rage and perhaps a certain
duplicity, especially in Melville's stories. For white women there have been other
anxieties. In the 1850s and 1860s, writers like Stowe and Alice Cary could converse quite 
comfortably in their prose with their dominantly female audience. But later, the practice of 
writing to a definitively female audience, as "lady novelists" were "expected" to do, might 
ensure the trivialization of one's work, especially in the hands of male critics. Cather 
seems to have imagined a significantly male audience, whereas at least some of the women 
modernists may have self-consciously spoken differently to male and to female 
readers.</p>

<p>For after all, the existence of a dual audience cannot be seen simply as a problem; it is 
also an opportunity, in at least two respects. First, in ideological terms, it allows an 
important community role to marginalized writers, as interpreters (even apologists) for 
their community to the "outside"–the "straight," the "vanilla"–world, even while becoming 
a source of instruction, delight, and power within. One thinks of writers like Langston 
Hughes and Adrienne Rich; indeed, this duality of audience helps explain some basic 
features of, and shifts in, their poetry and prose. The second opportunity is perhaps best 
suggested by a comment made in "Cultural Mis-readings by American Reviewers" by 
Maxine Hong Kingston apropos many of the misguided reviews of her first novel:

The audience of The Woman Warrior is also very specific. For example, I address Chinese 
Americans twice, once at the beginning of the book and once at the end. I ask some 
questions about what life is like for you, and, happily, you answer. Chinese Americans 
have written that I explain customs they had not understood.... There are puns for 
Chinese speakers only, and I do not point them out for non-Chinese speakers.  There are 
some visual puns best appreciated by those who write Chinese. I've written jokes in that 
book so private, only I can get them; I hope I sneaked them in unobtrusively so nobody 
feels left out. I hope my writing has many layers, as human beings have layers. (65)

The writer, thus addressing multiple audiences, emerges as trickster and clown, deferential 
and sweet even as she spins away with a grotesque gesture of . . . is it triumph? defiance? 
invitation? Survival is serious business that, it may be, cannot be taken all too 
seriously.</p>

<p>In a certain sense, citing Hughes and Kingston in the same paragraph suggests 
something about the related masks–of simplicity, invisibility, incapacity–minority writers 
have often chosen to present to at least part of their audience. But the two raise a 
profoundly contrasting question about audience as well. Hughes wrote regularly in the 
Chicago Defender and in books like Simple Speaks His Mind for an extensive black 
audience. It is not clear, as yet, how widely a writer like Kingston is heard within the 
Chinese American community. To be sure, the issue of who reads, who listens is not 
peculiar to marginalized writers. What is distinctive is the question of how, indeed 
whether, one can aspire to speak, at once, to generalized human concerns and for the 
particular experiences of a people defined in the world by caste and class and gender. At 
what, if any, historical moment is Invisible Man's assertion that perhaps "on the lower 
frequencies, I speak for you" true, or does Rich's "dream of a common language" become 
a reality? Can marginalized writers in practical ways speak both to the communities that 
nurtured them and to the majority audience that is part of the social and cultural fabric of 
oppression? When does aspiring toward the latter audience cut one off from the 
former?</p>

<p>I do not think there are easily generalizable answers to these questions, and the 
answers change over time But if the comparative strategy I have been proposing is a 
sensible approach to marginalized writing in the United States, then surely the problem of 
audience will be one of its critical foci.</p>

<p>A comparative approach to the literatures of the United States imposes serious 
scholarly and pedagogical responsibilities upon us.  We need to learn about, study, be 
sensitive to a far broader range of audiences, conventions, functions, histories and subjects 
than her in general been the case in literary analysis.14  And while I have touched on such 
issues here, I have not really addressed the large question of whether there are qualities of 
language and patterns of imagery distinctive to particular marginalized groups, concerns of 
consequence to some of our most notable critics today.</p>

<p>In pursuing such tasks, I think we should acknowledge the limitations of our own 
training.  For example, relatively few students of American literature are acquainted with 
the way oral cultures have influenced writing.  But rare indeed are those thoroughly 
familiar with more than one of the oral traditions of the United States, like those of 
American Indians and African Americans.  Some scholars of Emerson, Thoreau, and 
Whitman have shown how their work rings of platform and pulpit, but few are also 
knowledgeable about working-class or minority oral traditions.  In fact, a comparative 
approach could not have been proposed before 1975, because the detailed study of 
minority, ethnic, or even female cultures had not then sufficiently advanced:  too many 
texts were unavailable or unexamined; little had been done to pose comprehensive theo-
ries about African American literary traditions, the female imagination, the evolution of 
Chicano literature, and like subjects.</p>

<p>But such work has moved forward rapidly, and while it is not yet adequately reflected 
in undergraduate, much less in graduate school, curricula, the changes are notable.  
Further, we can learn from our colleagues in other fields.  For example, in approaching 
literary works still partly moving within the orbit of one or another oral tradition, we can 
benefit from the modes of studying early English texts. They remind us of how much work 
in linguistics and cultural and social history we must do in order to encounter the literary 
works.  Beyond that, many feminist and minority critics have perforce trained themselves 
as comparativists; their work exists as both challenge and lesson for the profession at 
large.  do not wish to exaggerate the difficulties of this task:  if we are, as I suggested at 
the beginning, not very far advanced in the processes of collective exploration, with 
commitment we may more rapidly than has seemed possible fill in the map and provide 
richer understanding of all the literatures of the United States.15</p>


Notes

'Cf Sommen; Sommers and Ybarra-Frausto, 37-38; for example, "Logically then, the 
trajectory of Chicano literature differs crucially from the mainstream models both of 
Mexico and the United States."

2 Thus the objection to most of the narrow graduate and undergraduate reading lists that 
have characterized the academic study of literature, and to the overemphasis on a limited 
set of paradigmatic critical texts–for instance, those of Derrida or Barthes. To sharpen the 
point of this objection, compare the indexes in books of almost any male theoretical critic–
structuralist or poststructuralist–with those in any of the recent collections of feminist and 
African American critics. The worlds of experience represented by these sets of references differ
profoundly, and in some cases absolutely.

3 For example, Ammons writes: "My thesis throughout is that Stowe's manipulation of 
maternal ideology is adapted and remodeled in illuminating ways in the work of American 
women writing before the 1920s and that, taken together, this body of fiction from Stowe 
forward constitutes a rich female tradition in American literature that challenges the 
dominant, twentieth-century, academic construction of the canon in terms of the adventure 
tale and the antisocial, which is to say antifeminine, escape narrative" ("Stowe's Dream" 
156).

4 Donovan has taken a somewhat different tack, attempting to rehabilitate such terms, as 
the title of one of her books illustrates: 'New England's Local Color Literature:  A 
Women's Tradition.

5 Cf. Toelken and Scott 80. Toelken asks the storyteller, Yellowman, why he narrates 
the tales. "'If my children hear the stories, they will grow up to be good people; if they 
don't hear them, they will turn out to be bad.' Why tell them to adults? 'Through the stories 
everything is made possible.'" Later Toelken and Scott examine the role of ritual (the 
stories) in establishing health through ordering "an otherwise chaotic scene" (88).

6 It may be interesting to compare this view of the African American creative artist with 
Houston Baker's appropriation of Trueblood, in Ellison's Invisible Man, to that role, in 
"To Move."

7 0ne can observe this phenomenon even in the most pastoral paintings created by the 
peasant anists of Solentiname, in Nicaragua. The subjects are seldom even remotely 
political, but the process of creating the paintings was a major factor in energizing and 
mobilizing the people to emerge from their sense of "marginalization" (the term is one they 
use) and enter the struggle against the Somoza dictatorship. That they could create art 
meant that they could create change.

8 Cf. Ybarra-Frausto: "Although the artist was free to experiment with form and content, 
the 'Plan de Aztlan' called for an art that was functional in extending the political 
consciousness of its audience.... The function of art is to extend and heighten our 
cognition of the world, its limitations and its potentialities for action. It is not an 
autonomous, internal mode of individual realization" (94).

9 A loving but critical comment by Edith Wharton helps underline certain of the 
limitations of James's outlook: "I sent the book [Proust's Du Cote de chez Swann] 
immediately to James, and his letter to me shows how deeply it impressed him. James, at 
that time, was already an old man and, as I have said, his literary judgments had long been 
hampered by his increasing preoccupation with the structure of the novel, and his 
unwillingness to concede that the vital centre (when there was any) could lie elsewhere. 
Even when I first knew him he read contemporary novels (except Wells's and a few of 
Conrad's) rarely, and with ill-concealed impatience; and as time passed, and intricate 
problems of form and structure engrossed him more deeply, it became almost impossible 
to persuade him that there might be merit in the work of writers apparently insensible to 
these sterner demands of the art" (Backward Glance 323). Cf. her comment on James's 
own late fiction on p. 190.

10 In general, many readers are willing enough to become engaged with people of higher 
status, with more money and power, than they. The problem Zola identifies is, we may 
say, to engage readers without condescension in a "downward" view.

11 In fact, as the Chicana poet Lorna Dee Cervantes has pointed out, code switching and 
other forms of verbal play are rather more characteristic of male Latino poetry than of 
female.

12 Cf. Toelken and Scott: "When I asked him if he told the tale exactly the same way each 
time, he at first answered yes; but when evidence from compared tapes was brought into 
the discussion, it became clear that he had understood me to be asking him if he changed 
the nature of the prototype tale of his own volition; the wording was different each time 
because he recomposed with each performance, simply working from his knowledge of 
what ought to happen in the story and from his facility with traditional words and phrases 
connected, in his view, with the business of narrating Ma'i stories. He did not mention it, 
but it is quite obvious from the tapes made of his stories when no children were present that the
audience plays a central role in the narrative style" (79-80).

13 Obviously, the debate over the canon, over books like E. D. Hirsch's Cultural Literacy,  
and over former education secretary William Bennett's curricular priorities involves 
precisely these issues.

14 Karl Kroeber writes: "In constructing hypothetical relations between their texture, text, 
and context, we can only improve and extend our appreciation of the art of the writers and 
enrich our understanding of the cultures from which their works emerged. Exactly the 
same exploring processes are appropriate and rewarding for Indian literatures, although 
often we must start from more basic elements because Indian literatures lack the wealth of 
earlier studies with which Western works are surrounded. It is our scholarship, not Indian 
literature, which is 'primitive' or undeveloped" ("An Introduction" 9).

15 I wish to thank both the Soviet and American participants in the Symposium on 
Literatures of American Ethnic Groups, Philadelphia, July 1985, for which this paper was 
originally prepared; Joel Conarroe, president of the Guggenheim Foundation; Andrew 
Wiget and Elizabeth Ammons for extremely helpful suggestions; and Ann Fitzgerald, 
without whose persistence and support it would not have been done. A longer and more 
detailed version of this anicle appears in my Canons and Contexts (Oxford).
