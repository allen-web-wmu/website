          Project</strong></font></font>
        <p align="left"> Drawing on our work this semester, and your best professional knowledge and skill, the final project for this class is  to analyze a literature-based course you current teach, or would like to teach, and develop a fleshed out vision of where you would like to take this course both in terms of curriculum and instruction.         
        <p align="left">Your final project will be turned as part of a website, wiki, blog, or Ning that you create, and that includes an on-line syllabus, links to information for students, parents, and colleagues, about the your approaches to curriculum and instruction. (Components of your analysis that you do not want to make public 
        can be turned in separately.)
        <p align="left">Your course should demonstrate a sound integration of theory and 
          practice, high expectations for student learning and work, inclusion of a variety of literary and cultural materials, and a discussion of your approach to standards and/or course expectations. Writing assignments and the writing process should be clearly 
          integrated into your course. Assume that you  can create the freedom you need to 
          design the course, purchase materials, and access technology. 
        <p align="left"> The  project should include:
        <p align="left">1. An introduction that describes the goals 
        / objectives of your course and its role in the educational system.         The introducation should include an  analysis of how the course is currently taught and how you intend to develop and transform the course in future. This can draw on writing you have already done for the class, but should revise, develop, and bring together earlier pieces.
        <p align="left">2. A statement about your approach to the selection of reading for the class, and the thematic and organizational principles of 
        your curriculum. 
        <p align="left">3. A statement about your approach to instruction.
        
        <p align="left"> 4. An outline or syllabus that sets forward the schedule 
          of the reading and writing assignments, topics of discussion, tests, 
          and other activities. The syllabus should serve in whole or part as 
          an &quot;electronic textbook,&quot; including web links to on-line literary 
          texts, historical or bibliographic resources or relevant websites. 
        <p align="left">5. Linked to the syllabus include sample plans for individual 
          lessons, study questions, threaded discussion questions, essay tests, 
          paper topics, etc.
        <p align="left">6. A resource page for colleagues that includes annotated 
        links to internet resources for teaching.        
        <p align="left">7. A thoughtful and progressive utilization of technology resources including on-line opportunities for student interaction and publication, such as threaded discussions, wikis, student blogs, websites, chat environments, virtual worlds, etc., and on-line curricular resources such as digital archives, cultural and historical websites, images, video and film.<br>
