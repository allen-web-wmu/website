        <p><font color="#33CCFF" size="+2"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"><strong>Professional Conference</strong></font></font></p>
        <p>
        <p align="left">A key goal of our course is preparing you to be a professionally active English teacher, a person who continaully engages in ongoing learning and development with other teachers and teacher professional organizations.</p>
        <p align="left">An expectation is attending a state and/or national English teacher conference. &nbsp;That could be the annual meeting of the <a href="http://www2.ncte.org/events/">National Council of the Teachers of English</a> (weekend before Thanksgiving) or the <a href="https://www.literacyworldwide.org/meetings-events">International Literacy Association Conference</a> (in October) held in different cities every year. </p>
        <p align="left">Or, smaller, less expensive, and still valuable, a state conference affiliate conference of the <a href="https://mymcte.org/">Michigan Council of the Teachers of English</a> or the <a href="https://www.michiganreading.org/">Michigan Reading Association</a>. </p>
        <p align="left">Of course during the pandemic there may need to be some online options. </p>
<p align="left">If you are absolutely unable to attend a professional conference, and have professor approval, you can substitute the conference by listening to about 6-8 hours of professional teacher videos or podcasts or reading professional teacher blogs. &nbsp;List of possibilties below. If you find others, check with the professor.</p>
        <p align="left">To get credit for completing the professional conference requirement whether you attended a conference or not send an email that to all class members, including the professor. &nbsp;Your email should include one to two pages of thoughts and reactions about your experience and specifics about what you learned.</p>
        <p align="left">If you attend a conference list the titles of the sessions you attended, describe each one of them with at least a couple of sentences - more is better-, rating each on a 5 star scale as well as writing about the whole experience. Describing only a couple of sessions leaves the impression that you didn't attend the full conference and will lower your grade.</p>
        <p align="left">If you completed the assignment on line your email include: 1) A list of all the the items you watched/read; 2) Indicate length; 3) give each a rating of one star to five stars (put URL's for 4 &amp; 5 stars so other students can view/listen/read them); and 4) Your thoughts and reactions as above.</p>
        <p align="left">Student often report that attending a professional conference is the outstanding event of the semester!</p>
        <p align="left">Of course, you are welcome, invited, and encouraged to attend more than one conference and to listen to / read lots of professional English teacher videos, blogs, and podcasts! </p>
