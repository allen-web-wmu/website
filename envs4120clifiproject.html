        <p align="left">For this unit the final project allows you to choose between four possibilities listed below. &nbsp;Before turning your project in write a paragraph or two of self-evaluation that describes the strengths and weaknesses of the project and proposes a grade. </p>
        <p align="left">1. Write your own climate change short story. Here are some suggestions for <a href="http://jerz.setonhill.edu/writing/creative1/shortstory/">writing short stories</a>.</p>
        <p align="left">2. Design a curricular unit to teach cli-fi literature as part of secondary English or Social Studies course. &nbsp;Here is a <a href="http://homepages.wmich.edu/~acareywe/litlesson.html">curricular unit assignment</a> from another class that might give you some ideas. &nbsp;You don't have to limit yourself to one work, in fact it makes sense to combine literature, non-fiction, and visual materials. As my assignment in the other class suggests you do not need to include a complete lesson plan for every day. &nbsp;Here are some suggestions for <a href="engl6780reading.html">young adult oriented cli-fi</a>.</p>
        <p align="left">3. Write an analysis of a climate change novel that we haven't read in our class. Here are some suggestions for <a href="engl6780reading.html">cli-fi novels</a>. Here are some of my comments, for a different class, about writing <a href="literaryanalysis.html">literary analysis</a> papers.</p>
        <p align="left">4. Write an analysis essay that addresses three climate change films. The idea is not three separate essays, but the exploration of one topic or issue and how it is addressed in three different films. Here are some suggestions for <a href="https://www.imdb.com/list/ls066770594/">cli-fi films</a>. &nbsp;Here is a webpage about <a href="http://www.mdc.edu/wolfson/academic/artsletters/art_philosophy/humanities/how_to_write_an_analytical_essay.htm">writing about film</a>. &nbsp;Here are some of my comments, for a different class, about writing <a href="literaryanalysis.html">literary analysis</a> papers. While the paper should obviously address important issues it would be nice if your paper could connect those issues to some analysis of specific scenes, and film "close reading" -- ie. consider details such as wardrobe, lighting, camera angle, sound track, special effects, location of shots, transitions, etc. </p>
