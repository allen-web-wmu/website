        <p>
        <p align="left">The climate crisis raises many questions of fairness and justice.  Who produces greenhouse gasses and other dangerous polutants from burning carbon, and who suffers first and most?  This assignment involves creating a blog post on a specific climate justice issue, and posting on <a href="https://climatejusticeissues.blogspot.com/" target="blank"> ClimateJusticeIssues.blogspot.com</a>. You will receive an email inviting you to post.</p>
			
			
		<p align="left">our post will examine a specific climate justice issue, and connect that examination to related ideas and resources on the web. A blog is a "web log" -- in its most essential form, a commentary on other sites on the web, so you can make connections with related topics, organizations, and ideas. Once the topic is selected there is substantial room for choice, creativity, and exploration of your own thinking and analysis.</p>
		  
	    <p align="left">Writing on the blog is in a public voice, thoughtful and careful, appropriate not only to the academic project of the class, but mindful of the possibility that your writing is published to a world-wide audience.</p>
        <p align="left">Your blog should meet these minimum requirements: </p>
		  <blockquote>
        
        <p align="left">Evidence of researching your climate justice topic and links to related sites on the web. Include at least 3 links. Don't just write the word "here" and make it a link or, at the other extreme, you don't need to write out the full URL of the source - instead, when you refer to it, make the link either to a few key words that capture the main idea of the article or to the title of the article and make either the key idea or the title a link to the full URL. When the links are there you don't need to have a separate bibliography.  </p>
		  
		   <p align="left">Your post should be between 800-1000 words. You can use AI to help develop your post, but you will want to improve it, and research and include solid, relevant links. Of course, as with any AI assisted writing your post will need to include an AI statement explaining how AI was used.</p>
		  
		   <p align="left">Your post should be visually attractive. Each post needs to include at least two or more images. </p>
			  
		<p align="left">I suggest drafting blog entries including AI text in your own word processing program before cutting and pasting into the blog. (It has happened that text written in the blog window has disappared before it is published. Using your own program protects you from losing text.) The blog is an easy-to-use space that allows you to incoporate text, images, and links, and to receive commentary by your classmates and other readers. </p>
		  </blockquote>
		  
	    <p align="left">You are expected to read at least 10 of the blog posts of your classmates and reply to them. Replies should not just say "good job" but join in the conversation about the post, comment on specific points in the post, open dialogue, raise questions and ideas, and further the thinking.  </p>
		  
		
	      <p align="left">List of possible climate justice blog topics:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p align="left">1. Intergenerational Justice: Failing to maintain the earth and its ecosystems in a livable condition for future generations.&nbsp;</p>
