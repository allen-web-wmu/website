        <p align="left">The climate crisis raises many questions of fairness and justice.  Who produces greenhouse gasses and other dangerous polutants from burning carbon, and who suffers first and most?  This assignment involves creating a blog post on a specific climate justice issue, and posting on ClimateJusticeIssue.Blogger.com <a href="aiclifi.html" target="blank"> Code</a>. You will receive an email inviting you to post.</p>
			
			
			<p>A blog is a "web log" -- in its most essential form, a commentary on other sites on the web. Your post will be about exploring connections between research, resources, news, commentary, and ideas on the web related to a specific aspect of climate justice. Once the topic is selected there is substantial room for choice, creativity, and exploration of your own thinking and analysis.</p>
		  <p align="left">Next, start playing with <a href="chat.openai.com" target="blank">ChatGPT</a>, or another generatiWriting on the blog is in a public voice, thoughtful and careful, appropriate not only to the academic project of the class, but mindful of the possibility that your writing is published to a world-wide audience.</p>
        <p align="left">Your blog should meet these minimum requirements: </p>
		  <blockquote>
        
        <p align="left">Evidence of researching your climate justice topic and links to related sites on the web. Include at least 3 links. Don't just write the word "here" and make it a link or, at the other extreme, you don't need to write out the full URL of the source - instead, when you refer to it, make the link either to a few key words that capture the main idea of the article or to the title of the article and make either the key idea or the title a link to the full URL. When the links are there you don't need to have a separate bibliography.  </p>
		  
		   <p align="left">Your post should be between 800-1000 words. You can use AI to help develop your post, but you will want to improve it, and develop solid links. Of course, as with any AI assisted writing your post will need to include an AI statement explaining how it was used.</p>
		  
		   <p align="left">Your post should be visually attractive. Each post needs to include at least two or more images. </p>
			  
		<p align="left">I suggest drafting blog entries in your own word processing program before cutting and pasting into the blog. The blog is an easy to use space that allows you to use images and links, and to receive commentary by your classmates and other readers. </p>
			  
			  <p aligh="left">You are expected to read all the blog posts of your classmates and reply to at least 10 of them. Replies should not just say "good job" but join in the conversation about the post, comment on specific points in the post, open dialogue, raise questions and ideas, and further the thinking.  </p>
