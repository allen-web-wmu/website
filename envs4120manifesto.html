        <p>
        <p align="left">The word "manifesto" comes from the Latin meaning "clear or conspicuous." &nbsp;It is a public declaration of the views of the issuer on a matter of great public importance. &nbsp;It puts forward ideas and describes how those ideas should be carried out. </p>
        <p align="left">We have read much of Karl Marx's <em>Communist Manifesto</em> and Pope Francis' <em>Laudato Si.</em> Of course, there are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto" target="_blank">more examples of the genre</a>. </p>
        <p align="left">The Communist Manifesto includes (1) an analysis and history of the world wide rise of capitalism and its current crisis, (2) a prescription for change including a series of demands and preliminary steps necessary to creating a just society, (3) a section which distinguishes its approach from other approaches, and (4) a call to action. &nbsp;It doesn't include (5) a specific vision of how a future society should be organized - something for which it has been criticized.</p>
        <p align="left">Drawing on our reading, discussion, and on your own independent research into the topic, I'd like you to write your climate justice manifesto. You may choose a specific audience to address or you can write for a general audience. &nbsp;Your manifesto should incorporate the five elements identified above, though not necessarily in that order or evenly balanced in length:</p>
        <p align="left">(1) a history and an analysis of the climate change crisis, drawing in part on what we have learned in our class; </p>
        <p align="left">(2) a plan for change including a series of demands and preliminary steps necessary to creating a just society; </p>
        <p align="left">(3) distinguish your approach from other approaches, and justify why your approach makes sense;</p>
        <p align="left">(4) a call to action, why the issue is important, why here and now, how does your audience get involved?; </p>
        <p align="left">(5) a specific vision of how a future society should be organized.</p>
        <p align="left">Throughout, in every one of the five elements, connect what you are saying to issues of climate justice. </p>
        <p align="left">You are writing about the greatest issue human beings and, perhaps, all life on Earth has ever faced. Show that you have a serious knowledge of the facts, history, politics, theories, issues, and ethics in question. </p>
        <p align="left">Write in a powerful and stirring public voice and use language that will appeal to and draw others to your position. Be thoughtful, courageous, passionate, and visionary. </p>
        <p align="left">Publish on line at Google Sites (?) and take advantage of the online format to include links, images, etc.</p>
