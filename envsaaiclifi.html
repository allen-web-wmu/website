        <p align="left">The goal of this assignment, and one of the key goals of the course, is to draw on the science of climate change and imagine what the future might be like, depending on how greenhouse gasses human beings continue to emit. For this assignment you will be contributing to the new website: <a href="aiclificom.html" target="blank">AICliFi.com</a> that will be a resource for Cli-Fi stories available to anyone! </p>
			<p align="left">First carefully read <em>Our Final Warning</em> by Mark Lynas. Identify conditions Lynas describes in the future where you would like to set a short story or stories.  You can create short stories at different global temperatures, or create them all at the same temperature but have the characters, setting, and action differ substantially.</p>
		  <p align="left">Next, start playing with <a href="https://chat.openai.com/" target="blank">ChatGPT</a>, and/or another generative AI program that will write stories. By varying your prompts and interacting with the program you want to develop 5 short stories that you find interesting. </p>
		  <p align="left">You might experiment with point of view, first person, third person, omniscient narrator, multiple narrators, etc. Are the characters, plot, and setting interesting? Dialogue is a dimension of many (not all) stories - can you work with ChapGP to use dialogue give insight into characters, create suspense, convey action, etc?</p> 
		  <p align="left">Does the story capture and reveal dimensions of how human society and perhaps the natural environment will be impacted by global heating?  Are there certain elements of that impact that you want to see if you can get ChatGPT to include?</p>
        <p align="left">Next, further develop your favorite story. At this stage you may want, but are not required, to take what ChatGPt produces and work it over yourself.  </p>
        
        <p align="left">Your best story is going to be included on the <a href="aiclificom.html" target="blank">AICliFi.com</a> website.  Go to an AI program that generates images and create and image that could go along with your story. You might look at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a>, &nbsp;<a href="https://creator.nightcafe.studio/">Creator.nightcafe.studio</a>, <a href="https://www.craiyon.com/">Craiyon</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/research/dall-e">Dall-E</a>, AI Art Generator, Dezgop, etc. Experiment until you have an image you like and that fits the story.</p>
<p align="left">Finally, write two or more pages of analysis of the stories you generated.  How did they differ?  Why did you like some better than others?  What did you learn about writing with AI? What did you learn about possible climate futures?</p>

		  <blockquote>
	        <p align="left">A) Your favorite short story (or stories) that you want published on the site. Each story to be published needs to have:&nbsp;</p>
			  <blockquote>
	        <p align="left">1) The degree of warming that the story is set at;&nbsp;</p>
	        <p align="left">2) The image that goes with the story;&nbsp;</p>
	        <p align="left">3) A title;&nbsp;</p>
	        <p align="left">4) A one sentence description of the content of the story that can be used on the index page to let readers know what your story is about and interest them in reading it - make the story sound appealing;&nbsp;</p>
	        <p align="left">5) The story itself; and,&nbsp;</p>
	        <p align="left">6) A short 2-4 sentence description of how you made the story on ChatGBT, prompts and/or suggestions. (This last description will be published at the end of your story.)</p>
		    </blockquote>
<p align="left">B) Your analysis of the stories and process, as described above 1-2 pages.</p>
          <p align="left">C) Lastly, the other 4 stories you generated. Give them titles too so I can tell them apart.</p>
