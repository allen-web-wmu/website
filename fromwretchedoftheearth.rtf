National liberation, national renaissance, the restoration of nationhood to the people, commonwealth: whatever may be the headings used or the new formulas introduced, decolonization is always a violent phenomenon. At whatever level we study it--relationships between individuals, new names for sports clubs, the human admixture at cocktail parties, in the police, on the directing boards of national or private banks--decolonization is quite simply the replacing of a certain "species" of men by another "species" of men. Without any period of transition, there is a total, complete, and absolute substitution. It is true that we could equally well stress the rise of a new nation, the setting up of a new state, its diplomatic relations, and its economic and political trends. But we have precisely chosen to speak of that kind of tabula rasa which characterizes at the outset all decolonization. Its unusual importance is that it constitutes, from the very first day, the minimum demands of the colonized. To tell the truth, the proof of success lies in a whole social structure being changed from the bottom up. The extraordinary importance of this change is that it is willed, called for, demanded. The need for this change exists in its crude state, impetuous and compelling, in the consciousness and in the-35- lives of the men and women who are colonized. But the possibility of this change is equally experienced in the form of a terrifying future in the consciousness of another "species" of men and women: the colonizers.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461 \par \tab }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461\charrsid1011461 Decolonization, which sets out to change the order of the world, is, obviously, a program of complete disorder. But it cannot come as a result of magical practices, nor of a natural shock, nor of a friendly understanding. Decolonization, as we know, is a historical process: that is to say that it cannot be understood, it cannot become intelligible nor clear to itself except in the exact measure that we can discern the movements which give it historical form and content. Decolonization is the meeting of two forces, opposed to each other by their very nature, which in fact owe their originality to that sort of substantification which results from and is nourished by the situation in the colonies. Their first encounter was marked by violence and their existence together--that is to say the exploitation of the native by the settler--was carried on by dint of a great array of bayonets and cannons. The settler and the native are old acquaintances. In fact, the settler is right when he speaks of knowing "them" well. For it is the settler who has brought the native into existence and who perpetuates his existence. The settler owes the fact of his very existence, that is to say, his property, to the colonial system.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461 \par \tab }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461\charrsid1011461 Decolonization never takes place unnoticed, for it influences individuals and modifies them fundamentally. It transforms spectators crushed with their inessentiality into privileged actors, with the grandiose glare of history's floodlights upon them. It brings a natural rhythm into existence, introduced by new men, and with it a new language and a new humanity. Decolonization is the veritable creation of new men. But this creation owes nothing of its legitimacy to any supernatural power; the"thing" which has been colonized becomes man during the same process by which it frees itself.In decolonization, there is therefore the need of a complete calling in question of the colonial situation. If we wish to describe it precisely, we might find it in the wellknown words: "The last shall be first and the first last." Decolonization is the putting into practice of this sentence. That is why, if we try to describe it, all decolonization is successful.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461 \par \tab }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461\charrsid1011461 The naked truth of decolonization evokes for us the searing bullets and bloodstained knives which emanate from it.

The native who decides to put the program into practice, and to become its moving force, is ready for violence at all times. From birth it is clear to him that this narrow world, strewn with prohibitions, can only be called in question by absolute violence.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461 \par \tab }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461\charrsid1011461 The colonial world is a world divided into compartments.

In capitalist societies the educational system, whether lay or clerical, the structure of moral reflexes handed down from father to son, the exemplary honesty of workers who are given a medal after fifty years of good and loyal service, and the affection which springs from harmonious relations and good behavior--all these aesthetic expressions of respect for the established order serve to create around the exploited person an atmosphere of submission and of inhibition which lightens the task of policing considerably. In the capitalist countries a multitude of moral teachers, counselors and "bewilderers" separate the exploited from those in power.

It is a world without spaciousness; men live there on top of each other, and their huts are built one on top of the other.

It is a town of niggers and dirty Arabs. The look that the native turns on the settler's town is a look of lust, a look of envy; it expresses his dreams of possession--all manner of possession: to sit at the settler's table, to sleep in the settler's bed, with his wife if possible. The colonized man is an envious man. And this the settler knows very well; when their glances meet he ascertains bitterly, always on the defensive, "They want to take our place."

The serf is in essence different from the knight, but a reference to divine right is necessary to legitimize this statutory difference. In the colonies, the foreigner coming from another country imposed his rule by means of guns and machines. In defiance of his successful transplantation, in spite of his appropriation, the settler still remains a foreigner. It is neither the act of owning factories, nor estates, nor a bank balance which distinguishes the governing classes.

It is not a treatise on the universal, but the untidy affirmation of an original idea propounded as an absolute. The colonial world is a Manichean world. It is not enough for the settler to delimit physically, that is to say with the help of the army and the police force, the place of the native. As if to show the totalitarian character of colonial exploitation the settler paints the native as a sort of quintessence of evil. * Native society is not simply described as a society lacking in values. It is not enough for the colonist to affirm that those values have disappeared from, or still better never existed in, the colonial world. The native is declared insensible to ethics; he represents not only the absence of values, but also the negation of values. He is, let us dare to admit, the enemy of values, and in this sense he is the absolute evil. He is the corrosive element, destroying all that comes near him; he is the deforming element, disfiguring all that has to do with beauty or morality; he is the depository of maleficent powers, the unconscious and irretrievable instrument of blind forces. Monsieur Meyer could thus state seriously in the French National Assembly that the Republic must}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid7938135  not be prostituted by allowing}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461\charrsid1011461 the Algerian people to become part of it. All values, in fact, are irrevocably poisoned and diseased as soon as they are allowed in contact with the colonized race. The customs of the colonized people, their traditions, their myths -- above all, their myths--are the very sign of that poverty of spirit and of their constitutional depravity. That is why we must put the DDT which destroys parasites, the bearers of disease, on the same level as the Christian religion which wages war on embryonic heresies and instincts, and on evil as yet unborn. The recession of yellow fever and the advance of evangelization form part of the same balance sheet. But the triumphant communiqu\u233\'8es from the missions are in fact a source of information concerning the implantation of foreign influences in the core of the colonized people. I speak of the Christian religion, and no one need be astonished. The Church in the colonies is the white people's Church, the foreigner's Church. She does not call the native to God's ways but to the ways of the white man, of the master, of the oppressor. And as we know, in this matter many are called but few chosen.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid7938135 \par \tab }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461\charrsid1011461 At times this Manicheism goes to its logical conclusion and dehumanizes the native, or to speak plainly, it turns him into an animal. In fact, the terms the settler uses when he mentions the native are zoological terms. He speaks of the yellow man's reptilian motions, of the stink of the native quarter, of breeding swarms, of foulness, of spawn, of gesticulations. When the settler seeks to describe the native fully in exact terms he constantly refers to the bestiary. The European rarely hits on a picturesque style; but the native, who knows what is in the mind of the settler, guesses at once what he is thinking of. Those hordes of vital statistics, those hysterical masses, those faces bereft of all humanity, those distended bodies which are like nothing on earth, that mob without beginning orend, those children who seem to belong to nobody, that laziness stretched out in the sun, that vegetative rhythm of life--all this forms part of the colonial vocabulary. General de Gaulle speaks of "the yellow multitudes" and Fran\u231\'8dois Mauriac of the black, brown, and yellow masses which soon will be unleashed. The native knows all this, and laughs to himself every time he spots an allusion to the animal world in the other's words. For he knows that he is not an animal; and it is precisely at the moment he realizes his humanity that he begins to sharpen the weapons with which he will secure its victory.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid7938135 \par \tab }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461\charrsid1011461 As soon as the native begins to pull on his moorings, and to cause anxiety to the settler, he is handed over to well-meaning souls who in cultural congresses point out to him the specificity and wealth of Western values. But every time Western values are mentioned they produce in the native a sort of stiffening or muscular lockjaw. During the period of decolonization, the natives's reason is appealed to. He is offered definite values, he is told frequently that decolonization need not mean regression, and that he must put his trust in qualities which are welltried, solid, and highly esteemed. But it so happens that when the native hears a speech about Western culture he pulls out his knife--or at least he makes sure it is within reach. The violence with which the supremacy of white values is affirmed and the aggressiveness which has permeated the victory of these values over the ways of life and of thought of the native mean that, in revenge, the native laughs in mockery when Western values are mentioned in front of him. In the colonial context the settler only ends his work of breaking in the native when the latter admits loudly and intelligibly the supremacy of the white man's values. In the period of decolonization, the colonized masses mock at these very values, insult t}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid7938135 hem, and vomit them up.\par \tab }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461\charrsid1011461 This phenomenon is ordinarily masked because, during the period of decolonization, certain colonized intellectuals have begun a dialogue with the bourgeoisie of the colonialist country. During this phase, the indigenous population is discerned only as an indistinct mass. The few native personalities whom the colonialist bourgeois have come to know here and there have not sufficient influence on that immediate discernment to give rise to nuances. On the other hand, during the period of liberation, the colonialist bourgeoisie looks feverishly for contacts with the elite and it is with these elite that the familiar dialogue concerning values is carried on. The colonialist bourgeoisie, when it realizes that it is impossible for it to maintain its domination over the colonial countries, decides to carry out a rearguard action with regard to culture, values, techniques, and so on. Now what we must never forget is that the immense majority of colonized peoples is oblivious to these problems. For a colonized people the most essential value, because the most concrete, is first and foremost the land: the land which will bring them bread and, above all, dignity. But this dignity has nothing to do with the dignity of the human individual: for that human individual has never heard tell of it. All that the native has seen in his country is that they can freely arrest him, beat him, starve him: and no professor of ethics, no priest has ever come to be beaten in his place, nor to share their bread with him. As far as the native is concerned, morality is very concrete; it is to silence the settler's defiance, to break his flaunting violence--in a word, to put him out of the picture. The wellknown principle that all men are equal will be illustrated in the colonies from the moment that the native claims that he is the equal of the settler. One step more, and he is ready to fight to be more than the settler. In fact, he has already decided to eject him a}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid7938135 nd to take his place; as}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461\charrsid1011461 we see it, it is a whole material and moral universe which is breaking up. The intellectual who for his part has followed the colonialist with regard to the universal abstract will fight in order that the settler and the native may live together in peace in a new world. But the thing he does not see, precisely because he is permeated by colonialism and all its ways of thinking, is that the settler, from the moment that the colonial context disappears, has no longer any interest in remaining or in co-existing. It is not by chance that, even before any negotiation * between the Algerian and French governments has taken place, the European minority which calls itself "liberal" has already made its position clear: it demands nothing more nor less than twofold citizenship. By setting themselves apart in an abstract manner, the liberals try to force the settler into taking a very concrete jump into the unknown. Let us admit it, the settler knows perfectly well that no phraseology can be a substitute for reality.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid7938135 \par \tab }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461\charrsid1011461 Thus the native discovers that his life, his breath, his beating heart are the same as those of the settler. He finds out that the settler's skin is not of any more value than a native's skin; and it must be said that this discovery shakes the world in a very necessary manner. All the new, revolutionary assurance of the native stems from it. For if, in fact, my life is worth as much as the settler's, his glance no longer shrivels me up nor freezes me, and his voice no longer turns me into stone. I am no longer on tenterhooks in his presence; in fact, I don't give a damn for him. Not only does his presence no longer trouble me, but I am already preparing such efficient ambushes for him that soon there will be no way out but that of flight.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid7938135 \par \tab }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461\charrsid1011461 We have said that the colonial context is characterized by the dichotomy which it imposes upon the whole people. Decolonization unifies that people by the radical decision to remove from it its heterogeneity, and by unifying it on a national, sometimes a racial, basis. We know the fierce words of the Senegalese patriots, referring to the maneuvers of their president, Senghor: "We have demanded that the higher posts should be given to Africans; and now Senghor is Africanizing the Europeans." That is to say that the native can see clearly and immediately if decolonization has come to pass or not, for his minimum demands are simply that the last shall be first.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid7938135 \par \tab }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461\charrsid1011461 But the native intellectual brings variants to this petition, and, in fact, he seems to have good reasons: higher civil servants, technicians, specialists--all seem to be needed. Now, the ordinary native interprets these unfair promotions as so many acts of sabotage, and he is often heard to declare: "It wasn't worth while, then, our becoming independent..."}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid7938135 \par \tab }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461\charrsid1011461 In the colonial countries where a real struggle for freedom has taken place, where the blood of the people has flowed and where the length of the period of armed warfare has favored the backward surge of intellectuals toward bases grounded in the people, we can observe a genuine eradication of the superstructure built by these intellectuals from the bourgeois colonialist environment. The colonialist bourgeoisie, in its narcissistic dialogue, expounded by the members of its universities, had in fact deeply implanted in the minds of the colonized intellectual that the essential qualities remain eternal in spite of all the blunders men may make: the essential qualities of the West, of course. The native intellectual accepted the cogency of these ideas, and deep down in his brain you could always find a vigilant sentinel ready to defend the Greco-Latin pedestal. Now it so happens that during the struggle for liberation, at the moment that the native intellectual comes into touch ag}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid7938135 ain with his people, this}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461\charrsid1011461 artificial sentinel is turned into dust. All the Mediterranean values--the triumph of the human individual, of clarity, and of beauty--become lifeless, colorless knickknacks. All those speeches seem like collections of dead words; those values which seemed to uplift the soul are revealed as worthless, simply because they have nothing to do with the concrete conflict in which the people is engaged.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid7938135 \par \tab }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461\charrsid1011461 Individualism is the first to disappear. The native intellectual had learnt from his masters that the individual ought to express himself fully. The colonialist bourgeoisie had hammered into the native's mind the idea of a society of individuals where each person shuts himself up in his own subjectivity, and whose only wealth is individual thought. Now the native who has the opportunity to return to the people during the struggle for freedom will discover the falseness of this theory. The very forms of organization of the struggle will suggest to him a different vocabulary. Brother, sister, friend--these are words outlawed by the colonialist bourgeoisie, because for them my brother is my purse, my friend is part of my scheme for getting on. The native intellectual takes part, in a sort of auto-da-f\u233\'8e, in the destruction of all his idols: egoism, recrimination that springs from pride, and the childish stupidity of those who always want to have the last word. Such a colonized intellectual, dusted over by colonial culture, will in the same way discover the substance of village assemblies, the cohesion of people's committees, and the extraordinary fruitfulness of local meetings and groupments. Henceforward, the interests of one will be the interests of all, for in concrete fact everyone will be discovered by the troops, everyone will be massacred--or everyone will be saved.

The oppressor, in his own sphere, starts the process, a process of domination, of exploitation and of pillage, and in the other sphere the coiled, plundered creature which is the native provides fodder for the process as best he can, the process which moves uninterruptedly from the banks of the colonial territory to the palaces and the docks of the mother country. In this becalmed zone the sea has a smooth surface, the palm tree stirs gently in the breeze, the waves lap against the pebbles, and raw materials are ceaselessly transported, justifying the presence of the settler: and all the while the native, bent double, more dead than alive, exists interminably in an unchanging dream. The settler makes history; his life is an epoch, an Odyssey. He is the absolute beginning: "This land was created by us"; he is the unceasing cause: "If we leave, all is lost, and the country will go back to the Middle Ages."

The native is a being hemmed in; apartheid is simply one form of the division into compartments of the colonial world. The first thing which the native learns is to stay in his place, and not to go beyond certain limits. This is why the dreams of the native are always of muscular prowess; his dreams are of action and of aggression.

The settler's world is a hostile world, which spurns the native, but at the same time it is a world of which he is envious.

Confronted with a world ruled by the settler, the native is always presumed guilty. But the native's guilt is never a guilt which he accepts; it is rather a kind of curse, a sort of sword of Damocles, for, in his innermost spirit, the native admits no accusation. He is overpowered but not tamed; he is treated as an inferior but he is not convinced of his inferiority. He is patiently waiting until the settler is off his guard to fly at him. The native's muscles are always tensed. You can't say that he is terrorized, or even apprehensive. He is in fact ready at a moment's notice to exchange the role of the quarry for that of the hunter. The native is an oppressed person whose permanent dream is to become the persecutor. The symbols of social order--the police, the bugle calls in the barracks, military parades and the waving flags--are at one and the same time inhibitory and stimulating: for they do not convey the message "Don't dare to budge"; rather, they cry out "Get ready to attack." And, in fact, if the native had any tendency to fall asleep and to forget, the settler's hauteur and the settler's anxiety to test the strength of the colonial system would remind him at every turn that the great showdown cannot be put off indefinitely. That impulse to take the settler's place implies a tonicity of muscles the whole time; and in fact we know that in certain emotional conditions the presence of an obstacle accentuates the tendency toward motion.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid7938135 \par \tab }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461\charrsid1011461 The settler-native relationship is a mass relationship. The settler pits brute force against the weight of numbers. He is an exhibitionist. His preoccupation with security makes him remind the native out loud that there he aloneis master. The settler keeps alive in the native an anger which he deprives of outlet; the native is trapped in the tight links of the chains of colonialism. But we have seen that inwardly the settler can only achieve a pseudo petrification. The native's muscular tension finds outlet regularly in bloodthirsty explosions--in tribal warfare, in feuds between septs, and in quarrels between individuals.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid7938135 \par \tab }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461\charrsid1011461 Where individuals are concerned, a positive negation of common sense is evident. While the settler or the policeman has the right the livelong day to strike the native, to insult him and to make him crawl to them, you will see the native reaching for his knife at the slightest hostile or aggressive glance cast on him by another native; for the last resort of the native is to defend his personality vis-\u224\'88-vis his brother. Tribal feuds only serve to perpetuate old grudges buried deep in the memory. By throwing himself with all his force into the vendetta, the native tries to persuade himself that colonialism does not exist, that everything is going on as before, that history continues. Here on the level of communal organizations we clearly discern the well-known behavior patterns of avoidance. It is as if plunging into a fraternal bloodbath allowed them to ignore the obstacle, and to put off till later the choice, nevertheless inevitable, which opens up the question of armed resistance to colonialism. Thus collective autodestruction in a very concrete form is one of the ways in which the native's muscular tension is set free. All these patterns of conduct are those of the death reflex when faced with danger, a suicidal behavior which proves to the settler (whose existence and domination is by them all the more justified) that these men are not reasonable human beings. In the same way the native manages to by-pass the settler. A belief in fatality removes all blame from the oppressor; the cause of misfortunes and of poverty is attributed to God: He is Fate. In this waythe individual accepts the disintegration ordained by God, bows down before the settler and his lot, and by a kind of interior restabilization acquires a stony calm....}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid7938135 \par \tab }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461\charrsid1011461 The peasantry is systematically disregarded for the most part by the propaganda put out by the nationalist parties.

For him there is no compromise, no possible coming to terms; colonization and decolonization are simply a question of relative strength.

The leaflet only expressed what every Algerian felt at heart: colonialism is not a thinking machine, nor a body endowed with reasoning faculties. It is violence in its natural state, and it will only yield when confronted with greater violence.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid8221789 \par \tab }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461\charrsid1011461 At the decisive moment, the colonialist bourgeoisie, which up till then has remained inactive, comes into the field. It introduces that new idea which is in proper parlance a creation of the colonial situation: non-violence. In its simplest form this non-violence signifies to the intellectual and economic elite of the colonized country that the bourgeoisie has the same interests as they and that it is therefore urgent and indispensable to come to terms for the public good. Non-violence is an attempt to settle the colonial problem around a green baize table, before any regrettable act has been performed or irreparable gesture made, before any blood has been shed. But if the masses, without, waiting for the chairs to be arranged around mebaize table, listen to their own voice and begin committing outrages and setting fire to buildings, the elite and the nationalist bourgeois parties will be seen rushing to the colonialists to exclaim, "This is very serious!

Compromise involves the colonial system and the young nationalist bourgeoisie at one and the same time. The partisans of the colonial system discover that the masses may destroy everything. Blown-up bridges, ravaged farms, repressions, and fighting harshly disrupt the economy. Compromise is equally attractive to the nationalist bourgeoisie, who since they are not clearly aware of the possible consequences of the rising storm, are genuinely afraid of being swept away by this huge hurricane and never stop saying to the settlers: "We are still capable of stopping the slaughter; the masses still have confidence in us; act quickly if you do not want to put everything in jeopardy." One step more, and the leader of the nationalist party keeps his distance with regard to that violence. He loudly proclaims that he has nothing to do with these Mau-Mau, these terrorists, these throat-slitters. At best, he shuts himself off in a no man's land between the terrorists and the settlers and willingly offers his services as go-between; that is to say, that as the settlers cannot discuss terms with these Mau-Mau, he himself will be quite willing to begin negotiations. Thus it is that the rear guard of the national struggle, that very party of people who have never ceased to be on the other side in the fight, find themselves somersaulted into the van of negotiations and compromise--precisely because that party has taken very good care never to break contact with colonialism.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid8221789 \par \tab }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461\charrsid1011461 Before negotiations have been set afoot, the majority of nationalist parties confine themselves for the most part to explaining and excusing this "savagery." They do not assert that the people have to use physical force, and it sometimes even happens that they go so far as to condemn, in private, the spectacular deeds which are declared to be hateful by the press and public opinion in the mother country. The legitimite excuse for this ultra-conservative policy is the desire to see things in an objective light; but this traditional attitude of the native intellectual and of the leaders of the nationalist parties is not, in reality, in the least objective. For in fact they are not at all convinced that this impatient violence of the masses is the most efficient means of defending their own interests. Moreover, there are some individuals who are convinced of the ineffectiveness of violent methods; for them, there is no doubt about it, every attempt to break colonial oppression by force is a hopeless effort, an attempt at suicide, because in the innermost recesses of their brains the settler's tanks and airplanes occupy a huge place. When they are told "Action must be taken," they see bombs raining down on them, armored cars coming at them on every path, machine-gunning and police action... and they sit quiet.

Today, however, the colonized countries' national struggle crops up in a completely new international situation. Capitalism, in its early days, saw in the colonies a source of raw materials which, once turned into manufactured goods, could be distributed on the European market. After a phase of accumulation of capital, capitalism has today come to modify its conception of the profit-earning capacity of a commercial enterprise. The colonies have become a market. The colonial population is a customer who is ready to buy goods; consequently, if the garrison has to be perpetually reinforced, if buying and selling slackens off, that is to say if manufactured and finished goods can no longer be exported, there is clear proof that the solution of military force must be set aside.

The monopolistic group within this bourgeoisie does not support a government whose policy is solely that of the sword.

It follows that it is closely involved in the liquidation of regionalism and of tribalism. Thus the national parties show no pity at all toward the caids and the customary chiefs.

Neither financiers nor industrial magnates are to be found within this national middle class. The national bourgeoisie of under-developed countries is not engaged in production, nor in invention, nor building, nor labour; it is completely canalized into activities of the intermediary type.

The national bourgeoisie steps into the shoes of the former European settlement: doctors, barristers, traders, commercial travellers, general agents and transport agents. It considers that the dignity of the country and its own welfare require that it should occupy all these posts. From now on it will insist that all the big foreign companies should pass through its hands, whether these companies wish to keep on their connexions with the country, or to open it up. The national middle class discovers its historic mission: that of intermediary.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid11228502 \par \tab }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461\charrsid1011461 Seen through its eyes, its mission has nothing to do with transforming the nation; it consists, prosaically, of being the transmission line between the nation and a capitalism, rampant though camouflaged, which today puts on the masque of neocolonialism. The national bourgeoisie will be quite content with the role of the Western bourgeoisie\rquote s business agent, and it will play its part without any complexes in a most dignified manner. But this same lucrative role, this cheap-jack\rquote s function, this meanness of outlook and this absence of all ambition symbolize the incapability of the national middle class to fulfil its historic role of bourgeoisie. Here, the dynamic, pioneer aspect, the characteristics of the inventor and of the discoverer of new worlds which are found in all national bourgeoisies are lamentably absent. In the colonial countries, the spirit of indulgence is dominant at the core of the bourgeoisie; and this is because the national bourgeoisie identifies itself with the Western bourgeoisie, from whom it has learnt its lessons. It follows the West-em bourgeoisie along its path of negation and decadence without ever having emulated it in its first stages of exploration and invention, stages which are an acquisition of that Western bourgeoisie whatever the circumstances. In its beginnings, the national bourgeoisie of the colonial countries identifies itself with the decadence of the bourgeoisie of the West. We need not think that it is jumping ahead; it is in fact beginning at the end. It is already senile before it has come to know the petulance, the fearlessness or the will to succeed of youth.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid11228502 \par \tab }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461\charrsid1011461 The national bourgeoisie will be greatly helped on its way towards decadence by the Western bourgeoisies, who come to it as tourists avid for the exotic, for big-game hunting and for casinos. The national bourgeoisie organizes centres of rest and relaxation and pleasure resorts to meet the wishes of the Western bourgeoisie. Such activity is given the name of tourism, and for the occasion will be built up as a national industry. If proof is needed of the eventual transformation of certain elements of the ex-native bourgeoisie into the organizers of parties for their Western opposite numbers, it is worth while having a look at what has happened in Latin America. The casinos of Havana and of Mexico, the beaches of Rio, the little Brazilian and Mexican girls, the half-breed thirteen-year-olds, the ports of Acapulco and Copacabana \emdash  all these are the stigma of this depravation of the national middle class. Because it is bereft of ideas, because it lives to itself and cuts itself off from the people, undermined by its hereditary incapacity to think in terms of all the problems of the nation as seen from the point of view of the whole of that nation, the national middle class will have nothing better to do than to take on the role of manager for Western enterprise, and it will in practice set up its country as the brothel of Europe.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid11228502 \par \tab }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461\charrsid1011461 Once again we must keep before us the unfortunate example of certain Latin American republics.

The big farmers have, as soon as independence was proclaimed, demanded the nationalization of agricultural production. Through manifold scheming practices they manage to make a clean sweep of the farms formerly owned by settlers, thus rein-forcing their hold on the district. But they do not try to introduce new agricultural methods, nor to farm more intensively, nor to integrate their farming systems into a genuinely national economy.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid11228502 \par \tab }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461\charrsid1011461 In fact, the landed proprietors will insist that the state should give them a hundred times more facilities and privileges than were enjoyed by the foreign settlers in former times. The exploitation of agricultural workers will be intensified and made legitimate. Using two or three slogans, these new colonists will demand an enormous amount of work from the agricultural labourers, in the name of the national effort of course. There will be no modernization of agriculture, no planning for development, and no initiative; for initiative throws these people into a panic since it implies a minimum of risk, and completely upsets the hesitant, prudent, landed bourgeoisie, which gradually slips more and more into the lines laid down by colonialism. In. the districts where this is the case, the only efforts made to better things are due to the government; it orders them, encourages them and finances them. The landed bourgeoisie refuses to take the slightest risk, and remains opposed to any venture and to any hazard. It has no intention of building upon sand; it demands solid investments and quick returns. The enormous profits which it pockets, enormous if we take into account the national revenue, are never reinvested. The money-in-the-stocking mentality is dominant in the psychology of these landed proprietors. Sometimes, especially in the years immediately following independence, the bourgeoisie does not hesitate to invest in foreign banks the profits that it makes out of its native soil.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid11228502 \par \tab }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461\charrsid1011461 On the other hand large sums are spent on display: on cars, country houses, and on all those things which have been justly described by economists as characterizing an under-developed bourgeoisie.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid11228502 \par \tab }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461\charrsid1011461 We have said that the native bourgeoisie which comes to power uses its class aggressiveness to corner the positions formerly kept for foreigners.

It will fight to the bitter end against these people \lquote who insult our dignity as a nation\rquote . It waves aloft the notion of the nationalization and Aricanization of the ruling classes.

If the national bourgeoisie goes into competition with the Europeans, the artisans and craftsmen start a fight against non-national Africans. In the Ivory Coast, the anti-Dahoman and anti-Voltaic troubles are in fact racial riots. The Dahoman and Voltaic peoples, who control the greater part of the petty trade, are, once independence is declared, the object of hostile manifestations on the part of the people of the Ivory Coast. From nationalism we have passed to ultra-nationalism, to chauvinism, and finally to racism. These foreigners are called on to leave; their shops are burned, their street stalls are wrecked, and in fact the government of the Ivory Coast commands them to go, thus giving their nationals satisfaction. ...}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid458955 \par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid6054336\charrsid1057539 \par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \li0\ri0\sl297\slmult0\nowidctlpar\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0\pararsid458955 {\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0\afs40 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\fs40\insrsid458955\charrsid13265107 ON NATIONAL CULTURE\par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \fi57\li0\ri0\sl182\slmult0\nowidctlpar\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0\pararsid458955 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461 [Full Version at }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461\charrsid1011461 https://www.facebook.com/NROPI/posts/349452621828073}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461 ]}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1011461\charrsid1057539 \par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid458955\charrsid1057539 \par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \fi244\li0\ri0\sl259\slmult0\nowidctlpar\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0\pararsid458955 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid458955\charrsid1057539 To }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\fs28\insrsid458955\charrsid1057539 take part in the African revolution it is not enough to write a revolutionary song; you must fashion the revo\-lution with the people.

On the contrary, we must become convinced that colonialism is incapable of procuring for the colonized peoples the material conditions which might make them forget their concern for dignity.

The Negroes of Chicago only resemble the Nigerians or the Tanganyikans in so far as they were all defined in rela\-tion to the whites. But once the first comparisons had been made and subjective feelings were assuaged, the American Negroes realized that the objective problems were fundamentally heterogeneous. The test cases of civil liberty whereby both whites and blacks in America try to drive back racial discrimination have very little in com\-mon in their principles and objectives with the heroic fight of the Angolan people against the detestable Portu\-guese colonialism. Thus, during the second congress of the African Cultural Society the American Negroes de\-cided to create an American society for people of black cultures.\par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \fi230\li0\ri0\sl259\slmult0\nowidctlpar\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0\pararsid13574286 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1057539\charrsid1057539 Negritude therefore finds its first limitation in the phenomena which take account of the formation of the historical character of men. Negro and African-Negro culture broke up into different entities because the men who wished to incarnate these cultures realized that every culture is first and foremost national, and that the prob\-lems which kept Richard Wright or Langston Hughes on the alert were fundamentally different from those which might confront Leopold Senghor or }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\fs28\insrsid1057539\charrsid1057539 Jomo }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1057539\charrsid1057539 Kenyatta. In the same way certain Arab states, though they had chanted the marvelous hymn of Arab renaissance, had nevertheless to realize that their geographical position and the economic ties of their region were stronger even than the past that they wished to revive. Thus we find today the Arab states organically linked once more with societies which are Mediterranean in their culture. The fact is that these states are submitted to modern pressure and to new channels of trade while the network of trade relations}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid13574286  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1057539\charrsid1057539 which was dominant during the great period of Arab his\-tory has disappeared. But above all there is the fact that the political regimes of certain Arab states are so different, and so far away from each other in their conceptions, that even a cultural meeting between these states is meaning\-less.\par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \fi225\li0\ri0\sl254\slmult0\nowidctlpar\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1057539\charrsid1057539 Thus we see that the cultural problem as it sometimes exists in colonized countries runs the risk of giving rise to serious ambiguities. The lack of culture of the Negroes, as proclaimed by colonialism, and the inherent barbarity of the Arabs ought logically to lead to the exaltation of cultural manifestations which are not simply national but continental, and extremely racial. In Africa, the move\-ment of men of culture }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid4868970\charrsid1057539 is a movement toward the Negro-African}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1057539\charrsid1057539  culture or the Arab-Moslem culture. It is not specifically toward a national culture. Culture is becom\-ing more and more cut off from the events of today. It finds its refuge beside a hearth that glows with passionate emotion, and from there makes its way by realistic paths which are the only means by which it may be made fruit\-ful, homogeneous, and consistent.\par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \fi244\li0\ri0\sl254\slmult0\nowidctlpar\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0\pararsid13574286 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1057539\charrsid1057539 If the action of the native intellectual is limited his\-torically, there remains nevertheless the fact that it con\-tributes greatly to upholding and justifying the action of politicians. It is true that the attitude of the native in\-tellectual sometimes takes on the aspect of a cult or of a religion. But if we really wish to analyze this attitude cor\-rectly we will come to see that it is symptomatic of the intellectual's realization of the danger that he is running in cutting his last moorings and of breaking adrift from his people. This stated belief in a national culture is in fact an ardent, despairing turning toward anything that will afford him secure anchorage. In order to ensure his salvation and to escape from the supremacy of the white man's culture the native feels the need to turn backward}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid13574286  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1057539\charrsid1057539 toward his unknown roots and to lose himself at whatever cost in his own barbarous people. Because he feels he is becoming estranged, that is to say because he feels that he is the living haunt of contradictions which run the risk of becoming insurmountable, the native tears himself away from the swamp that may suck him down and accepts everything, decides to take all for granted and confirms everything even though he may lose body and soul. The native finds that he is expected to answer for everything, and to all comers. He not only turns himself into the defender of his people's past; he is willing to be counted as one of them, and henceforward he is even ca\-pable of laughing at his past cowardice.\par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \fi225\li0\ri0\sl259\slmult0\nowidctlpar\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1057539\charrsid1057539 This tearing away, painful and difficult though it may be, is however necessary. If it is not accomplished there will be serious psycho-affective injuries and the result will be individuals without an anchor, without a horizon, colorless, stateless, rootless-a race of angels. It will be also quite normal to hear certain natives declare, "I speak as a Senegalese and as a Frenchman. . ." "I speak as an Algerian and as a Frenchman. . ." The intellectual who is Arab and French, or Nigerian and English, when he comes up against the need to take on two nationalities, chooses, if he wants to remain true to himself, the nega\-tion of one of these determinations. But most often, since they cannot or will not make a choice, such intellectuals gather together all the historical determining factors which have conditioned them and take up a fundamen\-tally "universal standpoint."\par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \fi240\li0\ri0\sl259\slmult0\nowidctlpar\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0\pararsid11228502 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1057539\charrsid1057539 This is because the native intellectual has thrown him\-self greedily upon Western culture.

The scandalized attitude with which the settlers who live in the colonial territory greet this new departure only serves to strengthen the native's decision.

In the first phase, the native intellectual gives proof that he has assimilated the culture of the occupying power. His writings correspond point by point with those of his opposite numbers in the mother country. His in\-spiration is European and we can easily link up these works with definite trends in the literature of the mother country. This is the period of unqualified assimilation.

This period of creative work approximately corresponds to that immersion which we have just described. But since the native is not a part of his people, since he only has exterior relations with his people, he is content to recall their life only.

During this phase a great many men and women who up till then would never have thought of producing a literary work, now that they find themselves in excep\-tional circumstances-in prison, with the Maquis, or on the eve of their execution-feel the need to speak to their nation, to compose the sentence which expresses the heart of the people, and to become the mouthpiece of a new reality in action.\par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \fi225\li0\ri0\sl259\slmult0\nowidctlpar\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0\pararsid13574286 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1057539\charrsid1057539 The native intellectual nevertheless sooner or later will realize that you do not show proof of your nation from its culture but that you substantiate its existence in the fight which the people wage against the forces of occupa\-tion. No colonial system draws its justification from the fact that the territories it dominates are culturally non\-existent. You will never make colonialism blush for shame by spreading out little-known cultural treasures under its eyes. At the very moment when the native intellectual is anxiously trying to create a cultural work he fails to realize that he is uh1izing techniques and language which are borrowed from the stranger in his country. He contents himself with stamping these instruments with a hallmark which he wishes to be national, but which is strangely reminiscent of exoticism. The native intellectual who comes back to his people by way of cultural achievements behaves in fact like a foreigner. Sometimes he has no hesitation in using a dialect in order to show his will to be as near as possible to the people; but the ideas that he expresses and the preoccupations he is taken up with have no common yardstick to measure the real situation which the men and the women of his country know. The culture that the intellectual leans toward is often no more than a stock of particularisms. He wishes to attach him\-self to the people; but instead he only catches hold of their outer garments. And these outer garments are merely the reflection of a hidden life, teeming and perpetually in motion. That extremely obvious objectivity which seems to characterize a people is in fact only the inert, already forsaken result of frequent, and not always very coherent, adaptations of a much more fundamental sub\-stance which itself is continually being renewed. The man of culture, instead of setting out to find this sub\-stance, will let himself be hypnotized by these mummified fragments which because they are static are in fact sym\-bols of negation and outworn contrivances. Culture has never the translucidity of custom; it abhors all simplifi\-cation. In its essence it is opposed to custom, for custom is always the deterioration of culture. The desire to at\-tach oneself to tradition or bring abandoned traditions to life again does not only mean going against the current of history but also opposing one's own people. When a people undertakes an armed struggle or even a political struggle against a relentless colonialism, the significance of tradition changes. All that has made up the technique of passive resistance in the past may, during this phase, be radically condemned. In an underdeveloped country during the period of struggle traditions are fundamentally unstable and are shot through by centrifugal tendencies. This is why the intellectual often runs the risk of being out of date. The peoples who have carried on the struggle are more and more impervious to demagogy; and those who wish to follow them reveal themselves as nothing more than common opportunists, in other words, late\-comers.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1057539\charrsid13574286 \par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \fi230\li0\ri0\sl259\slmult0\nowidctlpar\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0\pararsid13574286 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1057539\charrsid1057539 In the sphere of plastic arts, for example, the native}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid13574286  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1057539\charrsid1057539 artist who wishes at whatever cost to create a national work of art shuts himself up in a stereotyped reproduc\-tion of details.

There. is no other fight for culture which can develop apart from the popular struggle. To take an example: all those men and women who are fighting with their bare hands against French colonialism in Algeria are not by any means strangers to the national culture of Algeria. The national Algerian culture is taking on form and content as the battles are being fought out, in prisons, under the guillotine, and in every French outpost which is captured or destroyed.\par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \fi225\li0\ri0\sl259\slmult0\nowidctlpar\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0\pararsid13574286 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs28 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs28\insrsid1057539\charrsid1057539 We must not therefore be content with delving into the past of a people in order to find coherent elements which will counteract colonialism's attempts to falsify and harm.
