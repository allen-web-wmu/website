        Honesty Policy</b></font></p>
      <p>It is assumed that all students will always behave with the highest regard 
        for the honesty of their work in this course. Your work in this course 
        should be your own or the result of an honest and appropriate collaboration 
        with your classmates. Any sources you use, including internet sources, 
        should be fully and clearly documented. See me if you have any questions.</p>
      <p>This course will follow WMU academic integrity policies. The <a href="http://www.osc.wmich.edu/">Office 
        of Student Conduct</a> (3712 Faunce Student Services Building) can answer 
        <a href="http://www.osc.wmich.edu/studendconduct/faq.html">frequently asked 
        questions</a> about academic honesty.</p>
      <p>The WMU Faculty Senate urges all syllabi to include the following statement:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>You are responsible for making yourself aware of and understanding 
          the policies and procedures in the Undergraduate 
          Catalog (pp. 271-272) or the Graduate Catalog (pp. 24-26) that 
          pertain to Academic Integrity. These policies include cheating, fabrication, 
          falsification and forgery, multiple submission, plagiarism, complicity 
          and computer misuse. If there is reason to believe you have been involved 
          in academic dishonesty, you will be referred to the Office of Student 
          Conduct. You will be given the opportunity to review the charge(s). 
          If you believe you are not responsible, you will have the opportunity 
          for a hearing. You should consult with me if you are uncertain about 
          an issue of academic honesty prior to the submission of an assignment 
          or test. </p>
