        expectations for high school English in Michigan have been released by 
        the Michigan Department of Education. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These are some of the finest 
        language arts standards in the United States. They reflect research and 
        best practice in language arts content and instruction. They protect teacher 
        decision making and are not narrow, highly restrictive, grade-level-by-grade-level 
        standards being forced on teachers and students in many states by No Child 
        Left Behind. The standards do not include a list of required readings 
        for every student. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the words of the opening 
        of the document, these standards are &quot;intended to support conversatoins 
        at the school and district level.&quot; They are &quot;comprehensive&quot; 
        though &quot;not meant to be used as a proportional guide to curriculum 
        development... teachers are not expected to spend equal time on each standard.&quot; 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The proposed standards are 
        available at: <a href="standards.pdf">MDE High School Language Arts Standards</a>.
