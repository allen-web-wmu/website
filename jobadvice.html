        That says a great deal about you. Now as a graduate of WMU's program-the 
        third largest in the country-you are already a top prospect. As you go 
        through the whole job seeking process remember that you are not simply 
        &quot;qualified,&quot; &quot;capable,&quot; or &quot;able to do the job&quot; 
        but, instead, you are &quot;the best they could possibly hire,&quot; &quot;a 
        professional expert and leader,&quot; &quot;truly outstanding,&quot; &quot;a 
        teacher with a personal and professional vision.&quot; I constantly get 
        feedback from employers that students prepared in our program have an 
        excellent background and a state-of-the-art knowledge of English teaching. 
        Never be shy about what you believe in, about how good you are, or about 
        the quality of your preparation. Put your values and professional knowledge 
        out where people can see them. This is the approach most likely to get 
        you a job and to make you the kind of new teacher-leader schools are looking 
        for. Think how hard you have worked and how hard you <i>will</i> work 
        in your new job and you can begin to recognize how lucky the building/district/community 
        will be that gets to hire you!</font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">Plan that your job search will take a full year. 
        During this time you will be substituting, looking into graduate programs 
        (especially WMU's MA in English with an Emphasis in Teaching!), reading 
        <i>EJ</i> and other professional books, attending professional conferences, 
        participating in <a href="http://www.ncte.org">NCTE</a> and other professional 
        computer bulletin boards, staying in touch with fellow students and profs 
        at WMU, and, above all, doing the hard work of looking for the job you 
        really want. If you get hired right away, it may even be to your disadvantage 
        in the long run! The year of looking for a job, of learning how to get 
        the position you want, is an incredibly valuable and important part of 
        your education and preparation for the profession. In future years it 
        will be worth a great deal to know that you need never be stuck somewhere 
        you don't want to be. You can always get a job elsewhere.</font> Information

      <p> <font color="#0033CC" face="New York">Getting advice on resumes can 
        drive you crazy</font><font face="New York">: everyone says something 
        different and everyone is sure they know best. Be aware that education 
        resumes are significantly different from business resumes-many resume 
        &quot;experts&quot; don't know what a teaching resume should look like. 
        Here is my advice. By the way, it's 100% right!</font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">First, you don't need a resume; you need several 
        resumes, targeted to fit the different types of jobs you will be applying 
        for. You need a different resume for middle school and for high school. 
        You need a resume focused on working with &quot;at-risk&quot; students. 
        may want a resume focused on traditional suburban schools, one for rural 
        areas, one for the &quot;inner city.&quot; You might want a resume targeted 
        to alternative schools, religious schools, charter schools, or other specialized 
        institutions. You need versions of your resume that allow you to apply 
        for specialized positions in theater, journalism, mass media/speech, creative 
        writing, etc. as appropriate to your interests. You need resumes that 
        accent your minor or double major or that play to joint or interdisciplinary 
        positions in say English and Social Studies, or English and Spanish, or 
        English and Communications, etc. You may want a general resume that tries 
        to capture all the above for jobs you know nothing about. While many elements 
        may appear in common between your resumes, the changes in focus and content 
        that you make to target your resume to the position are critical to landing 
        the job. Obviously you need to have these different versions on your own 
        computer disk so you can play with them for the specific positions for 
        which you are applying. Work hard on your resume: it is the most important 
        document in the job search.</font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">You might begin the process of preparing resumes 
        by making one enormous rough draft, a &quot;throw in the kitchen sink&quot; 
        5-6 page version of your resume and then use it as a starter for developing 
        your more succinct targeted resumes. Even when you streamline it, the 
        single biggest mistake you are likely to make is to have a one-page resume. 
        One page is not enough for secondary English teaching positions. I suggest 
        the very nice strategy of a single piece of 11x17 paper folded into an 
        8-1/2xll facing page with your name, address, and phone on the cover, 
        the resume on both of the two inside pages, and references on the back 
        cover. This realy gives you four pages on a &quot;one page&quot; resume. 
        Be conscious of how you use space; don't crowd things together, or leave 
        big open areas on the sides or in margins. You can use some bold face 
        and perhaps more than one font, but be careful to keep the look simple 
        and easy to read. Use the form of your name you want people to call you 
        and leave off middle names or initials (as well as on the cover, your 
        name should appear again at the top of the first inside page). Job seekers 
        need to have a phone answering machine.</font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">The first category on the resume is &quot;Objective.&quot; 
        The objective is one of the most important parts of the resume; the second 
        biggest mistake you are likely to make is to say something like &quot;To 
        find a position as a Secondary English Teacher.&quot; Duh. Instead you 
        want to use the objective to target your resume to the specific job, to 
        demonstrate your values and commitments as a teacher and as a person, 
        and to show that you are prepared to be a professional leader to the other 
        teachers in the building/district where you will be hired. Work hard on 
        your objective and find ways to coordinate it with comments later on in 
        the resume about student teaching, prior accomplishments, interests, and 
        so on. Coordinate the objective with your cover letter and speak to it 
        at your interview and your primary values and philosophy as a teacher 
        shine through the whole hiring process. Throughout your resume use the 
        current professional language of English teaching in order to accurately 
        express your commitments, values, and vision, such as &quot;student-centered,&quot; 
        &quot;process writing,&quot; &quot;voice,&quot; &quot;skills in context,&quot; 
        &quot;cultural literacy,&quot; &quot;multicultural,&quot; &quot;canon,&quot; 
        &quot;objectives,&quot; &quot;assessment,&quot; &quot;portfolios,&quot; 
        &quot;empowerment,&quot; &quot;cultural studies,&quot;, &quot;critical 
        pedagogy,&quot; etc. Your objective should not be &quot;To find a position...,&quot; 
        but &quot;To create a... classroom where...&quot;</font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">After the objective the next category on your 
        resume should be &quot;Certification.&quot; List your areas of certification 
        in Michigan and use the official Michigan alphabetic code. (Secondary 
        English is &quot;BA.&quot;) </font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">The next category should be &quot;Education.&quot; 
        If you graduated from WMU's program, you have a bachelor's degree in English 
        (not in Education). You can describe your English major as &quot;in the 
        Secondary Education Curriculum,&quot; but if you have listed your certification 
        above, this is not necessary. In addition to the institution, degree, 
        and date of graduation, you could list by course title relevant, significant, 
        interesting, or graduate level course work taken. Listing a few course 
        titles can help the resume &quot;prove&quot; your objective, cover an 
        area that might otherwise appear weak, or demonstrate a knowledge or interest 
        relevant to a particular position. If you have entered a master's degree 
        program be sure to say so. Since you are going to be a secondary school 
        teacher it is important to list accomplishments and interests in high 
        school-this provides you with an excellent opportunity to show competence 
        in a variety of relevant areas from academics to extra curricular, potential 
        for coaching, etc. (Ignore the routine advice about not including high 
        school-a resume for secondary teaching is different.)</font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">If your gpa is less than 3.5, I would simply not 
        mention it. You can, however, list a gpa for your major or for English 
        Education classes if that is substantially higher. If you have been on 
        the Dean's list, you should say so. If you have won any awards or published 
        any creative works either in college or high school you should probably 
        mention them. You can assume that people know that WMU uses a 4.0 scale. 
        For many prospective employers gpa's are not a big deal.</font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">The next section should be &quot;Teaching Experience.&quot; 
        Start with subbing and/or any major, paid teaching experience. Next list 
        &quot;intern teaching.&quot; List the titles of classes you interned in. 
        Assume the reader knows that you had full charge of normal teaching responsibilities, 
        but describe with enough detail and professional language some of the 
        special/unique things you did as an intern to give them a flavor of your 
        approach. &quot;Show&quot; don't &quot;tell,&quot; as they say. For example, 
        rather than saying you &quot;developed curriculum,&quot; give specific 
        titles and activities. Do the same for your 301/302 participations. In 
        this section list any other teaching experiences, such as summer camps, 
        volunteer work, etc.</font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">The next section could be &quot;Work Experience.&quot; 
        Any form of employment or volunteer work that demonstrates an interest 
        in working with children or young people is relevant. Unless there is 
        something impressive and relevant to the classroom mention other work 
        experience only briefly, if at all. Having been a waitress will not get 
        you a job as a teacher and any employment unrelated to teaching must be 
        only a small part of the final resume. If you paid your way through college, 
        you can say so.</font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">You can have other categories on the resume including 
        &quot;Awards and Honors&quot;, &quot;Professional Activities and Memberships,&quot; 
        &quot;Coaching Experience/Interests,&quot; &quot;Volunteer Work,&quot; 
        etc. Under &quot;Professional Activities&quot; list your NCTE and MCTE 
        memberships, and for middle school be sure you are a member of the National 
        Middle School Association. List professional conferences attended, possibly 
        recent professional books read. Don't forget a category for &quot;Personal 
        Interests&quot; especially as they relate to teaching or adolescents (also 
        any international travel or foreign languages are good to include).</font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">At the end of the resume (on the back side of 
        the folding version) list all of your references including their titles, 
        addresses, and-most, important-phone numbers (even though disturbingly 
        few districts actually check references).</font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">Third biggest mistake: a spelling error in a resume 
        or cover letter.</font> 
      <p>Post your resume on your teaching web site. Burn your site onto a CD-ROM 
        calling card and enclose with your application letter. (For information 
        on creating a teaching web site see <a href="#Applying">Applying</a>.)

      <p> <font color="#0000CC" face="New York">Cover letters are wonderful opportunities 
        </font><font face="New York">to reveal who you are as a person and a professional 
        to a future employer. Don't be perfunctory, simple, generic, or short 
        in a cover letter. A personal, passionate, and professional cover letter 
        may be a crucial factor in getting you an interview. Like your resume, 
        the cover letter needs to be targeted to the specific job. If you don't 
        know enough about the job from the advertisement, call the school and 
        talk to the principal before you write the cover letter. Your cover letter 
        should be at least a very full page and can go to two pages. Talk about 
        the kind of teaching you believe in, about experiences that are important 
        to you and how they effect your commitments and philosophy, about what 
        you hope to keep learning about in the future. Don't assume that they 
        have the resume in front of them-go over the relevant high points of the 
        resume again. It is important to come off as academically/intellectually 
        strong and as interested in and caring about students different from yourself, 
        &quot;at-risk,&quot; or whatever. Show them that you are a good writer 
        by being both personal and professional. Don't be shy about offering to 
        bring new ideas, new energy, new strategies to the building you will come 
        to work in; this is the very reason why new teachers are hired. Be specific 
        about the approaches to English teaching that you would like to share 
        with others. At the same time express an openness to continued learning 
        and growth. The vision you are setting forward in the cover letter should 
        find its echo in the resume, and vice versa. </font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">Whenever possible, personally deliver your cover 
        letter and file to the principal or personal director (not their secretaries). 
        It is worth driving across the state to make such a delivery; try to get 
        a &quot;mini-interview&quot; at the same time. Ask for tours of the school, 
        chances to talk with other teachers and students, ask about attractive 
        things about the community. Throughout the job seeking process be aggressive 
        about contacting people, on the phone and especially in person. To you 
        it will seem like you might be irritating them or being &quot;pushy;&quot; 
        to them it will seem like you are eager, responsible, energetic, dedicated, 
        and ready to work.</font> <br>

        with Bronco Jobs Plus it becomes available to any potential employer browsing 
        the internet. Even if you plan to create your own file (as I recommend 
        below) and send your own materials, it is a good idea not only to register 
        for Jobs Plus but also to set up a credential file early in the job search. 
        Occassionaly such files are explicitly requested by a potential employer. 
        This needs to be done in person at the Career Services office on the first 
        floor of Ellsworth Hall. (Be sure to retain your own copies of materials 
        placed in the credential file as they do not return them.) During intern 
        teaching seminar you should also be provided with a registration packet. 
        When Career Services receives a request by a school district for names 
        of qualified candidates in secondary English they simply print resumes 
        off of the Bronco Jobs Plus and send them on. Prospective employers post 
        openings through Career Services, both directly on Bronco Jobs Plus and 
        through publication of the Career Services JOBS Bulletin. The bulletin 
        is available to review at Career Services free of charge. However, so 
        that you don't miss any postings, I suggest subscribing to the bulletin 
        and having it mailed to your home. Even though they are not specifically 
        targeted for education students, resume and mock interview sessions are 
        valuable; be aware that applying for an English teaching job differs in 
        some ways from applying in business or other fields. At Career Services 
        be sure to pick up the very useful pamphlet <i>The Job Search Hamdbook 
        for Educators</i> (published yearly by ASCUS, call (708) 864-1999). There 
        is a bulletin board in the hallway on the first floor of Ellsworth where 
        new positions are posted. Deveta Gardner (387-2745) is the career services 
        person assigned to help education students. Don't hesitate to ask for 
        her help. She is also working on ideas for how to use an education degree 
        as a step toward employment in business and other fields outside of education.</font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">Rather than having Career Services send your credential 
        file for you (at $5 a pop), I recommend that you also create and maintain 
        your own credential file and customarily send it out yourself. Have your 
        letters of reference sent to you and pick among these letters to create 
        the overall effect you want. Sending the file yourself will not hurt you 
        with employers-the vast majority will not even notice. Career Services 
        at WMU uses only open files anyway, and all they do is put a cover sheet 
        on the file and send it in their own envelope (an &quot;open file&quot; 
        is one where you can see the letters of recommendation and any other materials 
        the file contains). The credential file you send also needs to have a 
        copy of your certification and some version of your transcript (employers 
        are usually satisfied with a xerox copy-Career Services provides a nice 
        form for you to use for your transcript, the &quot;Undergraduate Course 
        Record Sheet&quot;-keep a copy for your portfolio and your own packet 
        of materials). Don't forget that you also want to have your teaching certificate! 
        Include it in your packet. To get your certificate apply to the Michigan 
        Department of Education, Teacher Certification Office in Lansing, costs 
        $125. </font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">Your letters should include your mentor teacher, 
        an English professor, an education professor (perhaps the one who teaches 
        your intern seminar-be sure s/he sees you teach), and another person that 
        knows about your potential for teaching (another teacher or administrator 
        in the building where you did your intern teaching may be a good choice-Be 
        sure to have such people observe you during intern teaching). An outstanding 
        letter from a student (from intern teaching, for example) is a nice addition. 
        Letters from past employers or family friends that do not know you in 
        a teaching/learning context are probably not very useful. If any one of 
        these letters does not make a strongly positive effect, don't use it. 
        You can include the final or midterm evaluation of student teaching-both 
        those written by your mentor and by you, if you want. The mentor's final 
        evaluation of student teaching can take the place of a letter if it is 
        complete and well written. Be aware that if a letter from your mentor 
        teacher is not included you may need to explain this at some point. (Everyone 
        recognizes that not all mentor teachers are perfect-so a simple explanation 
        of a &quot;conflict in styles&quot; will be sufficient if everything else 
        in your file looks good and you can speak about intern teaching in a positive 
        and engaging way.) The Final Evaluation of Intern Teaching written by 
        your mentor will automatically go into your placement file unless: 1) 
        you don't sign the release form, or 2) you specifically request Career 
        Services to put the Final Evaluation into the &quot;Inactive&quot; part 
        of your file. </font> 
      <p> <i><font face="New York">Always send your whole file</font></i><font face="New York">, 
        never just your resume and cover letter alone. This is true even when 
        they ask only for resumes. The more schools have from you the better; 
        and if your file is for some reason &quot;incomplete&quot; it can cost 
        you the interview. Be extremely kind to people who write letters for you-thank-you 
        letters are appreciated. Recommenders need time to write, but if you have 
        a deadline or one comes up, let them know. You need to keep your references 
        informed about what is going on in your job search. When your resume is 
        finished be sure to send a copy to all references and recommendation writers. 
        If they get a phone call they need to be ready to speak about you and 
        know where you are in your search. For example, if there is more than 
        one district interviewing you they can convey this to the hiring committee 
        in a discrete and effective way. </font> <br>

      <p> <font color="#0033FF" face="New York">These days you need to have a 
        beautiful, complete, and <i>clearly organized</i> ELECTRONIC teaching 
        portfolio, published on the web.</font><font face="New York"> First, all 
        schools are looking for teachers that know how to use technology well. 
        Creating an interactive teaching web site that also serves as your portfolio 
        is a basic requirement for teaching these days. You can present your portfolio 
        as a web address, you can burn it on to a CD ROM or even a CD ROM calling 
        card, and/or you can go to your interview with a laptop computer to show 
        it off. See my page on <a href="engl480site.html">creating your teaching 
        website</a> for further explanation and examples. </font> 
      <p><font face="New York">Rather than organizing your portfolio in the categories 
        of the midterm and final evaluation of student teaching (as the College 
        of Education recommends), I suggest organizing it to address the different 
        strands of Language Arts teaching. Thus you might have a section on &quot;Teaching 
        the Writing Process&quot; (with subsections on &quot;Prewriting,&quot; 
        &quot;Drafting,&quot; &quot;Editing,&quot; &quot;Publishing&quot; and 
        even &quot;Teaching Grammar in Context&quot;), on &quot;Teaching Literature&quot; 
        (with subsections on &quot;British Literature,&quot; &quot;American Literature,&quot; 
        &quot;Multicultural Literature,&quot; &quot;Poetry,&quot; &quot;Thematic 
        Approaches&quot; etc.), &quot;Speaking and Listening&quot; and so on. 
        Include sections on special interests relevant to English teaching, such 
        as &quot;Journalism,&quot; &quot;Creative Writing,&quot; &quot;Speech 
        and Debate,&quot; &quot;Yearbook,&quot; &quot;Drama,&quot; &quot;Family 
        Life Education,&quot; &quot;Business English,&quot; &quot;Interdisciplinary 
        Teaching with Social Studies and History,&quot; depending on your interests 
        and background. You could have a section on &quot;Classroom Management,&quot; 
        &quot;Classroom Climate,&quot; or &quot;Positive Discipline.&quot; You 
        could have a section on &quot;Professional Activities&quot; that foregrounds 
        your membership in MCTE and NCTE (for middle school be sure to be a member 
        of the National Middle School Association), attendance at conferences, 
        professional reading, etc. If you coach or have interests in particular 
        extracurricular activities these could also be highlighted in a special 
        section. I suggest a brief, two or three sentence statement of your philosophy 
        of teaching at the beginning of each of the sections or subsections and 
        a statement at the beginning of the portfolio that combines all of these. 
        All of these can be separate pages on your web site.</font> 
      <p><font face="New York">All the materials in your application packet, resume, 
        letters of recommendation, teaching certificate, unofficial transcript, 
        etc. should be included again in the portfolio. Pictures are worth a thousand 
        words-photos of you with students from preinterning or interning are invaluable. 
        Samples of outstanding student work done under your guidance should be 
        included. Streaming video clips that capture moments of your teaching 
        and/or student response on the web site are impressive. Interviewers usually 
        do not have the time to read papers from courses at WMU</font><font face="Helvetica">, 
        </font><font face="New York">but succinct lesson plans, smart-looking 
        handouts, tests or other materials you have created for the classroom 
        are relevant. (On the other hand, it is very important to keep all your 
        English and education papers and course material for future reference; 
        be sure you have a clearly organized system of file folders that you can 
        draw on in the years to come. You can build these materials onto your 
        web site.)</font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">I believe that the primary beneficiary of the 
        portfolio is you. Your portfolio helps you bring together your preparation 
        and focus it toward the kind of teaching you want to do. It gives you 
        confidence, helps you recognize how much you have accomplished, and just 
        how lucky the district will be that gets you. To what extent the portfolio 
        is part of the hiring process depends somewhat on you. At the interview 
        you should take the initiative to pass it around and speak to/demonstrate 
        specific things in it. If you leave it with the interview committee it 
        may be ignored unless you have really drawn on it during the interview 
        (any thing you really want the interview committee to see should be separately 
        copied and handed out by you to all members of the committee). Some places 
        will ask to see the portfolio, and it is very useful at job fairs. Some 
        places may not know much about these portfolios, they may not ask for 
        them, and may not know what you are talking about when you bring them 
        up. Be prepared to educate or drop the issue depending on the reaction 
        you get. <br>

      <p> <font color="#0033CC" face="New York">The applying process really begins 
        before you graduate</font><font face="New York">; often students end up 
        finding jobs through connections made during interning. Network with other 
        teachers and administrators in the building, inviting them to your class 
        during the last weeks of intern teaching to watch and give you pointers. 
        Stop in and meet the personnel director at the central office. Provide 
        him/her with a resume and also invite s/he to stop by and see you in action. 
        Remind other teachers that you will be on the market and ask if they have 
        heard of any openings. If your mentor is happy with you, be sure s/he 
        says so to administrators and others who have a lead on a job elsewhere.</font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">Right after intern teaching-maybe even before 
        it is over-start examining Bronco Jobs Plus and begin applying. Apply 
        to every conceivable opening. Don't rule possibilities out until you have 
        multiple offers! Teaching jobs can surprise you; sometimes something in 
        a place or institution you would never have considered turns out to be 
        ideal. If there is something right up your alley, and where you want to 
        live, make a personal visit to hand-deliver your materials right away. 
        Follow up with letters/phone calls on a regular basis. Don't be defeated 
        by the impersonality of large districts; they simply require more persistence. 
        Alternative schools and special programs for &quot;at risk&quot; students 
        are often looking for new people and new energy. Peterson's <i>Independent 
        Secondary Schools</i> and Paterson's <i>American Education</i> are books 
        that lists private schools across the country (available in the Career 
        Resources Center, 1st floor Ellsworth). They are valuable resources in 
        applying to many very interesting schools. Always attend job fairs. Although 
        they can be a depressing experience, a real &quot;meat market&quot; as 
        they say, I have known many students to get jobs through these events. 
        Employers take them seriously and be prepared for real interviews. WMU's 
        Teacher Placement Day is in April. MSU, CMU, EMU all have teacher placement 
        days that you can attend-plan to hit several. Career Resources has a book 
        that lists recruitment fairs in states across the country. Enthusiasm 
        is key at job fairs-and have smart and colorful handouts from your portfolio 
        to leave with interviewers. Job fairs are a good opportunity to look into 
        working in other states. Teaching in another part of the country can be 
        very exciting and facilitate your personal growth and education. The Career 
        Resources Center also has a book, <i>Teacher Certification Requirements 
        in all Fifty States</i> (Boydston, 1995) that has the information you 
        need if you are thinking of going to a different state. You can also get 
        this information more quickly from sites on the web. Try: the University

      <p> <font face="New York">Definitely consider applying to international 
        jobs! There are many opportunities for English teachers both in American 
        style schools abroad as well as teaching English language (ESL). Begin 
        by checking out the excellent web site for <a href="http://www.tefl.com">Teaching 
        English as a Foreign Language</a>. This site includes job listings. Many 
        overseas American schools hire through either the Overseas Placement Service 
        at the University of Northern Iowa (319) 273-2081 or the International 
        School Services (recruitment centers in Boston and New Orleans), PO Box 
        5910; Princeton, NJ 08543 (609) 452-0990. For the Department of Defense 
        schools call 1-800-736-0008. The major publication for overseas educators 
        also posts job listings: TIE (The International Educator); Overseas School 
        Assistance Corp.; P.O. Box 513; Cummaquid, MA 02637; 508-362-1414. You 
        can look at the <i>Teaching Overseas Handbook</i> and check <i>ISS Directory 
        of Overseas Schools</i> for names and address (both at the Career Resources 
        Center). The <a href="http://www.peacecorps.org/">Peace Corps</a> is always 
        looking for English teachers. Japan is an excellent place to look for 
        opportunities teaching English abroad; look at the <a href="http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/jet/index.html">JET 
        website</a>. The McDonalds of English language institutes, with franchised 
        schools world wide is the <a href="http://www.wallst.ch/">Wall Street 
        Institute</a>; they also are always looking for English teachers (connect 
        to their &quot;jobs&quot; link). You may have more freedom now that any 
        other time in your life. Take advantage of it!</font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">Following the usual methods is important, but 
        not enough. A great number of students land English teaching jobs by making 
        &quot;cold&quot; contacts at schools where a position has not yet been 
        advertised. A very good approach to is to go to the <a href="http://www.mde.state.mi.us/reports/scm/">Michigan 
        Schools Directory </a>listing the addresses and phone numbers of all the 
        schools in Michigan. (The same information is available non-electronically 
        in the <i>Michigan Education </i>can copy this book at the Career Resources 
        Library or purchase your own copy by calling MDE at (517) 482-8464.) Using 
        this on-line directory (or the book), call all the school secretaries 
        in the area you decide to concentrate on and ask them if they know of 
        any openings coming up for English teachers-they may have heard of something 
        even before the principal does! When you find a &quot;hot&quot; possibility, 
        call the principal, hand deliver your file, and stay in regular contact. 
        I know a young woman with a 2.6 gpa who had three offers in no time by 
        using this approach. [ By the way the <a href="http://www.mde.state.mi.us/">Michigan 
        Department of Education</a> has a good web site with lots of resources 
        beyond the directory.]</font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">Be aware of the hiring schedule of districts. 
        They may do their most intense looking in the late spring and early summer 
        so that is the time to be sure to be ready and active. On the other hand, 
        hiring goes on all year long. At the time of a sudden opening if you are 
        the one who happens to be there, you may be the one to get the position. 
        Schools also do a good deal of hiring at the last minute. After a summer 
        of frustration, you may suddenly find yourself with opportunities the 
        week before school starts or even during the first couple of weeks of 
        the new year. Make your presence known and obvious always and especially 
        at these times.</font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">As you go through the job hunting process you 
        should be continually refining and improving your materials, skills and 
        strategies. If you don't have a position after a year (very unlikely if 
        you are following the Carey-Webb plan!), you need to thoroughly reexamine 
        your materials and approach. (You aren't still using a one-page resume, 
        are you??? You are making plenty of cold calls, right???) At this point 
        there is also another option to consider: a professional employment agency 
        or job placement service (also called &quot;third party recruiters&quot; 
        and &quot;head hunters&quot;). You can find phone numbers of such services 
        listed on the Want Ad pages of the Chicago papers. As these services continue 
        to grow Career Services may have some information or suggestions. I know 
        several people who have gotten jobs with the help of a placement service, 
        but they had to promise to hand over their first child in exchange (Actually, 
        you pay a percentage of your first year's income...).</font> <br>

      <p> <font color="#0033FF" face="New York">This is the crucial event</font><font face="New York"> 
        that all of your job seeking efforts have led up to. Never turn down an 
        interview, even if it involves travel and expense for you or is for a 
        position you are virtually certain you don't want. Interviews help you 
        clarify your own values. You learn a tremendous amount from them, and 
        the experience is invaluable. Treat all interviews with enthusiasm and 
        respect.</font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">You need to do several mock interviews before 
        the real thing. These should be done with fellow students, family members, 
        and, best of all, with people who resemble potential employers, teachers 
        or administrators. Take advice but also trust your judgment. Video and 
        audio taping mock interviews is a good idea (I did it, and it helped me). 
        Write up questions that you are likely to be asked and get practice answering 
        them until you can do so directly, clearly and simply. </font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">The subject of the interview is you. You are the 
        expert on that topic and know more than anyone else present (parents do 
        not usually attend interviews). Thus you should be confident and knowledgeable. 
        Dress up, but be sure that you still look like a teacher. </font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">Interact personally with the interviewers. Use 
        their names, tell them they asked a good question, learn about their interests/values/ideas. 
        Throughout the interview it is best to give shorter answers that directly 
        respond to the question asked and then offer to say more if they would 
        like you to explain further. Be able to use specific examples from intern 
        or other teaching experiences. They may not remember what is on your resume, 
        even the big obvious things, so don't hesitate to repeat the resume: &quot;As 
        I mention on my resume, I have...&quot;</font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">If a question stumps you, remake the question 
        into something you can answer: &quot;What I hear you asking is... And 
        to this I think... Did I answer your question?&quot; Bring handouts to 
        the interview to demonstrate different kinds of teaching you can do. When 
        a question might tie to these handout say, &quot;I brought something along 
        that might help me show you what I mean...&quot; Bring up your portfolio 
        <i>before</i> they ask to see it. In this way you are also taking some 
        responsibility for determining the way the interview will proceed-if you 
        have also shown you can listen well, this strategy makes you look like 
        the kind of confident teacher they will want to hire. </font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">The interview is a very important time to use 
        professional English teaching language. Know your stuff, both in theory 
        and practice! Review your course books before the interview. During the 
        interview talk about a book you have read, an article in the <i>English 
        Journal</i> or <i>Rethinking Schools</i> and explain how you modified 
        and ran with the idea in some part of your intern teaching. </font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">Have three or four &quot;success&quot; stories 
        from your intern teaching ready to tell (and perhaps illustrate with samples 
        of student work). You might be asked for an example of how you worked 
        with a student different from yourself, how you overcame and managed to 
        reach a resistant learner, how you got along with a difficult colleague, 
        etc.</font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">Have clearly thought out ideas about what you 
        want to teach, both individual lessons and whole units. Be able to talk 
        enthusiastically and in detail about specific works of literature relevant 
        to the teaching assignment. When asked how you would teach something be 
        sure to first set forward your goals and objectives, address the need 
        to investigate students' prior knowledge, and discuss appropriate ways 
        to evaluate and assess what your students have learned. Bring up literary 
        works that are in the canon and works that are not in the canon, showing 
        your interest, knowledge, and skill with both. </font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">You are very likely to be asked the grammar question. 
        The right answer is, &quot;In the context of student's own writing.&quot; 
        Then explain how the teaching of grammar fits into a process writing approach 
        and depends on an authentic assessment of each student's writing and skill 
        development. Talk about the importance of good writing skills and segue 
        into the need for developing voice, cultural literacy, critical thinking, 
        etc. </font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">You may be asked about a personal challenge, interest, 
        or experience; have some answers ready. Be able to talk about why you 
        decided to go into teaching and where you see yourself five years down 
        the road (earning a master's degree, active in the professional organization, 
        etc.). </font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">You will be asked, in one form or another, a question 
        about classroom discipline. The key pieces of the right answer include: 
        1) I emphasis prevention rather than reaction-good lessons with relevant 
        content are less likely to lead to discipline issues in the first place-if 
        discipline issues arise it is a clue to reexamine the way I have structured 
        the lesson-I notice things quickly and adjust/react before they build; 
        2) I attempt to assess if the student understands the assignment, knows 
        what s/he is supposed to be doing, sees why the assignment is meaningful; 
        3) A simple set of classroom rules that is clearly understood is helpful; 
        4) I almost always try to take care of discipline issues myself by talking 
        with students privately rather than sending them to the vice principal; 
        4) If a discipline issue persists good communication with parents and 
        vice principals is, of course, important.</font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">You will be asked: &quot;Do you have any further 
        questions?&quot; This is a crucial opportunity to impress your interviewers. 
        I suggest two types of questions: 1) What kind of direction do you see 
        your department (to a department chair) / school (to a principal) / district 
        (to a central office administrator) going in? What kind of new teachers 
        are you looking for? This question not only shows that you care about 
        what they care about, it also provides you with very valuable information-information 
        you would obviously like to have as early in the interview process as 
        possible! (Nonetheless, all schools want to see themselves as moving in 
        positive directions, as being professional current, as being more student-centered, 
        as attracting energetic new teachers.) 2) I would like to continue to 
        attend English teacher conferences, will there be support for my own professional 
        development? Is there support for graduate courses I might take? What 
        kinds of professional development opportunities might there be? </font> 
      <p><font face="New York">For further ideas about what kinds of questions 
        you might be asked check out the <a href="http://www.ncte.org/inbox/interview.shtml">NCTE 
        Interview Questions for Preservice Teachers</a>.</font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">Expressing interest in extracurricular activities 
        or specialized courses is a good idea. If you coach, fine, but English 
        teachers can do just as well if they will work on the student paper, yearbook, 
        creative writing magazine, speech or debate team, coach drama, direct 
        plays, become involved with student government, etc. By the way, if your 
        first job assignment does not have exactly the classes you most want to 
        teach, don't fret about it. Once you are in a school it is usually possible 
        to begin to change your responsibilities and move toward the specific 
        courses you want. Often classes that you didn't think would be your favorite 
        turn out to be great experiences.</font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">Don't be surprised if you are asked to write something 
        before or after the interview; bring an erasable pen and perhaps a small 
        spelling dictionary. You may be asked to model or demonstrate your teaching 
        with the interview committee or with actual students. In general, the 
        more hoops they have you go through, the more interviews and the more 
        carefully they follow-up with references, the better off you will be when 
        you work for them. A district that does a careful job hiring is a district 
        with its priorities in the right place.</font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">After the interview send a warm, personal, and 
        correctly-spelled thank-you note. If all goes well you are likely to be 
        called back for a second interview. If there are new people you may have 
        to repeat a few things from the first interview because it is sometimes 
        hard for interviewers to keep all the facts about each candidate straight. 
        Try to learn about the culture of the school and the interests of your 
        future colleagues. Second interviews are typically more relaxed, yet it 
        is important to continue to be confident and professional. If you are 
        taken to meet the superintendent that's a good sign-get him (always men, 
        alas) talking about the future directions of the district.</font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">Never bring up salary or benefits until after 
        the offer is made. If they start talking salary, listen carefully for 
        a few minutes, then interrupt or comment that you are more interested 
        in talking about how they view teaching, about what the students or your 
        colleagues would be like, etc.</font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">If your interview does not lead to an offer, call 
        the interviewer back and ask if s/he would be willing to share with you 
        what they saw as the strengths and weaknesses of your application and 
        interview. They may be able to give you useful advice and even leads on 
        other jobs. </font> <br>

      <p> <font color="#0033FF" face="New York">This is the moment you have been 
        waiting for.</font><font face="New York"> If it is a job you want, the 
        pressure to say yes right away is incredible. Nonetheless I am convinced 
        that you should never accept an offer right away, even if it is for a 
        match made in heaven. Give yourself at least a few days to think about 
        it. Make them sweat. (They made you sweat.) Doing so will be very helpful 
        to your reputation and respect as you arrive in your new position. Of 
        course, you ask for time to think about the offer by telling them how 
        delighted you are to receive it, how exciting it would be to be in their 
        district, and so on...</font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">If you have serious reservations about the job, 
        I still advise waiting before you say &quot;no.&quot; At the least it 
        shows respect for the effort and interest they have taken in you. Talk 
        to several people you trust to be sure you are making the right move before 
        turning an offer down. After thinking about the offer for a few days, 
        share your reservations honestly with the person who made the offer and 
        ask if there are other people you could talk to address your concerns. 
        If the job is really not right for you, don't take it. A better job will 
        come along.</font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">After receiving the offer (and before accepting 
        it) it is a good idea to get the name of the districts' benefits officer 
        and met with or talk with this person to go over the benefits package 
        and salary carefully. It is less stressful to talk to a such a person 
        than to the people who have been interviewing you. </font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">If you are lucky you may be in the position of 
        multiple offers or offers with other interviews still ongoing. As much 
        as someone who has made an offer wants to rush, the key for you is <i>take 
        your time</i>. As I have said, making an offer wait is OK. With an offer 
        in hand you are in a strong position to contact any other job that you 
        have been looking into and let those people know where you stand. Might 
        their interest in you be serious? How much time will they need to make 
        their decision? Don't hesitate to use the offer as a bargaining chip to 
        get an interview or speed up a process elsewhere. Hold off the offer as 
        long as you can-though eventually you need to be clear what is happening, 
        &quot;I have an interview with another attractive position in a couple 
        of days, and I will get back to you immediately afterward.&quot; Play 
        both possibilities along as long as you can.</font> 
      <p> <font face="New York">While, of course, you want to have a signed contract, 
        a verbal offer is an offer. Open the champagne. </font> <br>

      <p> <font face="New York">When you start your new job </font><font color="#0033FF" face="New York">you 
        are the principal's darling</font><font face="New York">. Use that very 
        special position to good effect. For example, you are more likely to be 
        able to order new books as a new teacher. Seek out the advice of the veterans, 
        but also keep your channels with the principal open. Focus your first 
        year on your classes and avoid extra duties. Bring your enthusiasm to 
        your colleagues by turning their negative stories about students or classes 
        into questions about how to improve your own teaching (If I have a student 
        (or class) like that what are some things I could do?). Listen to students 
        to find out who the good teachers are, and take the time needed to culture 
        the friendship of the people in the building you respect. Teach what you 
        believe in, and send letters to parents telling them what you are doing 
        and inviting their participation. Some teachers phone all their students 
        parents just to introduce themselves-a great way to start off! Don't send 
        kids to the vice principal or let them out before the bell rings! </font>
