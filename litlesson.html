The unit plan should demonstrate your understanding of a justice, inquiry, and action approach to teaching literature. </p>
        <p align="left"><p align="left">Identify the anticipated grade level and course in which you would teach 
          this unit.
        Your unit should be between 3-6 weeks in length.
        <p align="left">Your unit plan will be presented in class in a 5 minute Google Slide Presentation. &nbsp;Your slides shouldneeds to include: </p>

        <p align="left">Teachers borrow other teachers work. &nbsp;However, as a future teacher completing a course assignment, you need to be careful about citation and plagiarism. &nbsp;For this assignment I expect to see your own work and thinking consistent with what we are learning in this class. &nbsp;If you do borrow, modify, or use any ideas, bits, or pieces from others <em>cite your sources</em>; in an online document your citiation should include a <em>link to the sources</em>, if possible.</p>
