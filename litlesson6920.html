        <p><font color="#33CCFF" size="+2"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"><strong>Justice, Inquiry, &amp; Action Justice Unit Plan</strong></font></font></p>
        <p>
        <p align="left">This unit plan should be designed around a specific literary work (novel, play,  several short stories, collection of poems, or other genre) that serves as an anchor text in a thematic unit appropriate to secondary teaching. The unit plan should demonstrate your understanding of a justice, inquiry, and action approach to teaching literature. It should also incorporate your learning so far in the MAT program, including curriculum, assessment, diversity and anti-racist teaching, and disciplinary literacy. It would be ideal if the unit you designed would be something you could actually teach in whole or in part during your internship this semester or next semester. For that reason you may want to choose an anchor text that already in the school curriculum. You are encouraged to consult with your mentor teacher in the development of the unit.</p>
        <p align="left"><p align="left">Identify the anticipated grade level and course in which you would teach 
          this unit.
        Your unit should be between 4-6 weeks in length.
        <p align="left">Your unit plan should  include: </p>
        <p align="left">1) A brief description of three <em>English Journal</em> articles related to your text, theme, or approach.</p>
		  <blockquote>To find articles connected to the unit you are going to lead will want to conduct an ERIC 
	          search (via our <a href="http://libguides.wmich.edu/content.php?pid=209545&sid=1745865" target="_blank">library database access</a>). For articles on specific literary works or thematic topics, <strong>first</strong> set &quot;English Journal&quot; as the &quot;SO Journal Title&quot; Field. (Use quotation marks around "English Journal" - even with quotation marks on "English Journal" you may still get journals like "Arab World English Journal," which you can ignore. Look out: without the quotation marks many different journals will come up.) <strong>Second</strong>, for another Field use descriptive terms for your literary work or thematic topic (try different key word variations to find the best articles). (You will get the most articles if for your topic you use the field "TX All Text" which searches the full text of articles, not just titles or descriptors. Title and descriptor searches can be good if you are getting <em>too many</em> articles). </p>
          .</blockquote>
        <p align="left">2) A description of how your unit will address issues of justice. </p>
<p align="left">        
<ul>
          <li>
            <div align="left">How does this issue connect to the lives of your students and/or important issues in the world? </div>

          </li>
          <li>
            <div align="left">What additional pieces might you draw in to help develop student understanding of the topic or their questions? (Might include other literary works, film, non-fiction materials, images, websites, speakers, etc.) </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div align="left">How can students examine different perspectives on the topic? </div>

            <div align="left">How does/might the topic engage controversy? What can you do to &quot;create freedom&quot; to address this topic with secondary students?</div>
          </li>

        </ul>
        <p align="left">3) A clear indication of how your students will engage in inquiry. </p>
        <p align="left"><ul>
		                <li>
            <div align="left">How will you foster their asking of meaningful questions?         </div>

            <div align="left">What critical questions will students likely be exploring?<br>

          <li>
            <div align="left">How will their questions help them better understand important issues and the world around them?        </div>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div align="left"><p align="left">4) How does the unit lead to students taking action to address the issue?</div>
   
        <p align="left">5) Include several different kinds of writing assignments using different genres, and describe how these assignments fit with best practice approaches to composition instruction.</p>
			
			 <p align="left">6) Describe the grade level and social/cultural background of your students and explain how the age and background of your students factors into the content and methods of the unit. Describe also how you will address a diversity of reading abilities in your class, and how you would support ELL students. </p>
        <p align="left">
        <p align="left">7) An overview or &quot;syllabus&quot; of the sequence of lessons 
        and activities that will comprise your unit. </p>
        <p align="left">
        <p align="left">8) A developed idea for a specific lesson or activity </p>
		  <p align="left">9) Include a description of a final paper or project or cumulative activity that students will write/engage in and an explanation of this activity addresses the learning goals you established.</p>
       
        
        
        <p align="left">Your unit plan should be at least 15 pages. Also prepare a short Google Slide presentation 8-10 slides about the unit that you can share with the class. </p>
        
        <p align="left">Teachers borrow other teachers work. However, as a future teacher completing a course assignment, you need to be careful about citation and plagiarism. For this assignment I expect to see your own work and thinking consistent with what we are learning in this class. If you do borrow, modify, or use any ideas, bits, or pieces from others <em>cite your sources</em>; in an online document your citiation should include a <em>link to the sources</em>, if possible.</p>
