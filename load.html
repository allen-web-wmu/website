      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">There are 
        three (3) ways to load your site to homepages. (We are only going to elaborate 
        on homepages, since this is the platform that the IT lab uses. Other platforms 
        will be difficult to get help with.)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">First thing's 
        first, create your site.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">1. Click 
        on <b>&quot;Site&quot;</b> on your top toolbar. Go to <b>&quot;Define 
        Sites.&quot;</b> Give your site a name. (The title of your index page 
        is good. Or your last name.) Choose your root by clicking on the folder 
        icon (next to <b>&quot;Root&quot;</b>). It is a good idea to use a zip 
        disk, since the network or your computer will freeze quite a bit. By using 
        a disk and SAVING OFTEN, you will not lose precious hours of work. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">2. Now, on 
        your left window, choose <b>&quot;Remote Info.&quot;</b> It will have 
        this weird little <b>&quot;Server Access&quot;</b> box. Choose <b>&quot;FTP&quot;</b> 
        preference. Only enter the following information: <b>&quot;Host: homepages.wmich.edu&quot;</b> 
        <b>&quot;Username: a4carey&quot;</b> (this is an example name). DO NOT 
        ENTER YOUR PASSWORD HERE, IT WILL SAVE IT TO THE HARD DRIVE. You will 
        have an opportunity to enter it later. Choose <b>&quot;Passive FTP&quot;</b> 
        as a preference at the bottom, you will incur fewer errors when loading.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">3. Click 
        <b>&quot;OK.&quot;</b> Click <b>&quot;Done.&quot;</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Site window 
        will appear-- don't close!!* The Local Server is your disk on the right.<br>
        The Remote Server is homepages on the left. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF3333">First 
        Way to Load Your Site: (This is the ideal way to load your site in its 
        entirety--or several pages at one time).<br>
        1. Connect to the server. (This is where it will ask for your password).<br>
        2. Select the files you would like to load in your local server window. 
        <br>
        3. Click on the blue <b>&quot;up&quot;</b> arrow, this means <b>&quot;Put&quot;</b> 
        in loading language.<br>
        4. ALWAYS INCLUDE DEPENDENT FILES--otherwise you will lose cute little 
        pictures and links. <br>
        5. It will spin, think, and then you should be up in the server. If you 
        receive an error, be sure that it is not simply due to the server being 
        down. If it is a larger problem than the server, visit the IT lab.<br>
        6. View your site in both Netscape and Internet Explorer to be sure you've 
        got what you want. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#9933CC">Second 
        Way to Load Your Site: (An individual page by page way).<br>
        1. Save your page. (If you don't, it may load an earlier draft).<br>
        2. Go to <b>&quot;Site&quot;</b> on your top toolbar. Scroll to <b>&quot;put.&quot;</b> 
        This will prompt a connection to the server (if not currently connected). 
        <br>
        3. ALWAYS INCLUDE DEPENDENT FILES.</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#9933CC"><br>
        4. View your site in both Netscape and Internet Explorer to be sure you've 
        got what you want.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#0033CC">Third 
        Way to Load Your Site: (The low-maintenance way).<br>
        1. Save your page. (If you don't, it may load an earlier draft).<br>
        2. Click on the up/down,<b> &quot;Put/ Get&quot;</b> arrows. This will 
        prompt a connection to the server (if not currently connected).<br>
        3. ALWAYS INCLUDE DEPENDENT FILES.<br>
        4. View your site in both Netscape and Internet Explorer to be sure you've 
        got what you want. </font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">If you have 
        already loaded your site, and you are reloading, make sure to click <b>&quot;Refresh&quot;</b> 
        in your browser to get the most recent edition.</font></p>
