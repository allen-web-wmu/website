          A spectre is haunting Europe -- the spectre of communism. ...</p>
        </div>
      <div align="center">
        <div align="left"> 
          <p> The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class 
            struggles.</p>
          <p>Freeman and slave, patrician and plebian, lord and serf, guild-master 
            and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant 
            opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, 
            now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary 
            reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending 
            classes.</p>
          <p>In the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a complicated 
            arrangement of society into various orders, a manifold gradation of 
            social rank. In ancient Rome we have patricians, knights, plebians, 
            slaves; in the Middle Ages, feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, 
            journeymen, apprentices, serfs; in almost all of these classes, again, 
            subordinate gradations.</p>
          <p>The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of 
            feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but 
            established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of 
            struggle in place of the old ones.</p>
          <p>Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this 
            distinct feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as 
            a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, 
            into two great classes directly facing each other -- bourgeoisie and 
            proletariat.</p>
          <p>From the serfs of the Middle Ages sprang the chartered burghers of 
            the earliest towns. From these burgesses the first elements of the 
            bourgeoisie were developed.</p>
          <p>The discovery of America, the rounding of the Cape, opened up fresh 
            ground for the rising bourgeoisie. The East-Indian and Chinese markets, 
            the colonisation of America, trade with the colonies, the increase 
            in the means of exchange and in commodities generally, gave to commerce, 
            to navigation, to industry, an impulse never before known, and thereby, 
            to the revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society, a rapid 
            development.</p>
          <p>The feudal system of industry, in which industrial production was 
            monopolized by closed guilds, now no longer suffices for the growing 
            wants of the new markets. The manufacturing system took its place. 
            The guild-masters were pushed aside by the manufacturing middle class; 
            division of labor between the different corporate guilds vanished 
            in the face of division of labor in each single workshop.</p>
          <p>Meantime, the markets kept ever growing, the demand ever rising. 
            Even manufacturers no longer sufficed. Thereupon, steam and machinery 
            revolutionized industrial production. The place of manufacture was 
            taken by the giant, MODERN INDUSTRY; the place of the industrial middle 
            class by industrial millionaires, the leaders of the whole industrial 
            armies, the modern bourgeois....</p>
          <p>We see, therefore, how the modern bourgeoisie is itself the product 
            of a long course of development, of a series of revolutions in the 
            modes of production and of exchange.</p>
          <p>Each step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied by 
            a corresponding political advance in that class. An oppressed class 
            under the sway of the feudal nobility, an armed and self-governing 
            association of medieval commune: here independent urban republic (as 
            in Italy and Germany); there taxable &quot;third estate&quot; of the 
            monarchy (as in France); afterward, in the period of manufacturing 
            proper, serving either the semi-feudal or the absolute monarchy as 
            a counterpoise against the nobility, and, in fact, cornerstone of 
            the great monarchies in general -- the bourgeoisie has at last, since 
            the establishment of Modern Industry and of the world market, conquered 
            for itself, in the modern representative state, exclusive political 
            sway. The executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing 
            the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.</p>
          <p>The bourgeoisie, historically, has played a most revolutionary part....</p>
          <p>The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the 
            instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, 
            and with them the whole relations of society. Conservation of the 
            old modes of production in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the 
            first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant 
            revolutionizing of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social 
            conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the 
            bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast frozen relations, 
            with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, 
            are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they 
            can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is 
            profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his 
            real condition of life and his relations with his kind.</p>
          <p>The need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases 
            the bourgeoisie over the entire surface of the globe. It must nestle 
            everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connections everywhere.</p>
          <p>The bourgeoisie has, through its exploitation of the world market, 
            given a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in every 
            country. To the great chagrin of reactionaries, it has drawn from 
            under the feet of industry the national ground on which it stood. 
            All old-established national industries have been destroyed or are 
            daily being destroyed. They are dislodged by new industries, whose 
            introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilized nations, 
            by industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material, but 
            raw material drawn from the remotest zones; industries whose products 
            are consumed, not only at home, but in every quarter of the globe. 
            In place of the old wants, satisfied by the production of the country, 
            we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of 
            distant lands and climes. In place of the old local and national seclusion 
            and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction, universal 
            inter-dependence of nations. And as in material, so also in intellectual 
            production. The intellectual creations of individual nations become 
            common property. National one-sidedness and narrow-mindedness become 
            more and more impossible, and from the numerous national and local 
            literatures, there arises a world literature.</p>
          <p>The bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production, 
            by the immensely facilitated means of communication, draws all, even 
            the most barbarian, nations into civilization. The cheap prices of 
            commodities are the heavy artillery with which it forces the barbarians' 
            intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate. It compels 
            all nations, on pain of extinction, to adopt the bourgeois mode of 
            production; it compels them to introduce what it calls civilization 
            into their midst, i.e., to become bourgeois themselves. In one word, 
            it creates a world after its own image.</p>
          <p>The bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the towns. 
            It has created enormous cities, has greatly increased the urban population 
            as compared with the rural, and has thus rescued a considerable part 
            of the population from the idiocy of rural life. Just as it has made 
            the country dependent on the towns, so it has made barbarian and semi-barbarian 
            countries dependent on the civilized ones, nations of peasants on 
            nations of bourgeois, the East on the West.</p>
          <p>The bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the scattered 
            state of the population, of the means of production, and of property. 
            It has agglomerated population, centralized the means of production, 
            and has concentrated property in a few hands. The necessary consequence 
            of this was political centralization. Independent, or but loosely 
            connected provinces, with separate interests, laws, governments, and 
            systems of taxation, became lumped together into one nation, with 
            one government, one code of laws, one national class interest, one 
            frontier, and one customs tariff.</p>
          <p>The bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has 
            created more massive and more colossal productive forces than have 
            all preceding generations together. Subjection of nature's forces 
            to man, machinery, application of chemistry to industry and agriculture, 
            steam navigation, railways, electric telegraphs, clearing of whole 
            continents for cultivation, canalization or rivers, whole populations 
            conjured out of the ground -- what earlier century had even a presentiment 
            that such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labor? 
            ... </p>
          <p> Modern bourgeois society, with its relations of production, of exchange 
            and of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic means 
            of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer who is no longer 
            able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called 
            up by his spells. ...</p>
			<p>In place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes and class antagonisms, we shall have an association, in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all. ...</p>
          <p>The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly 
            declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow 
            of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble 
            at a communist revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but 
            their chains. They have a world to win.</p>
