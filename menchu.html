<hr>
<p> In 1999 David Stoll, in <i>Rigoberta Menchú and the Story of All Poor Guatemalans</i>, 
  claimed that Rigoberta Menchú, winner of the 1992 Nobel Peace Prize, had falsified 
  facts about herself in her 1983 testimony, the account that first brought her 
  to world attention. Moreover, Stoll argued that liberal university professors 
  who supported the Guatemalan resistance movement had embraced Menchú's story 
  without question. When Stoll's book was published<i>The New York Times </i>ran 
  a front page article questioning Menchú's integrity and the controversy entered 
  the popular press. Although many editorial writers picked up the tone of Stoll's 
  criticism, a collection of essays, by established experts on Guatemala and Menchú's 
  testimony, titled <i>Properties of Words: Rigoberta Menchú, David Stoll, and 
  Identity Politics in Central America</i>, was published before the year was 
  over and seriously challenged Stoll's data, inferences, and conclusions. (I 
  have written a chapter in that book describing the skepticism, difficulties, 
  and critical reflections that Menchú's testimony often evokes in the classroom.) 
</p>
<p>In considering the public controversy it is important to carefully examine 
  the charges David Stoll has actually made. An attentive reading of Rigoberta 
  Menchú and the Story of All Poor Guatemalans makes it clear that the initial 
  press reports on Stoll's research were sensationalistic. While <i>The New York 
  Times</i> claimed that Rigoberta Menchú &quot;fabricated,&quot; &quot;seriously 
  exaggerated,&quot; and told &quot;one lie after another&quot; in her testimonial, 
  the surprising fact is that Stoll's research, on the contrary, actually serves 
  to affirm the truth of Menchú¹s story in all of its major points, certainly 
  those points that are most relevant to the vast majority of American teachers 
  and students who have worked with Menchú's testimonial. </p>
<p>David Stoll is a professional anthropologist who, over the course of ten years, 
  interviewed Guatemalans and undertook archival research focused on identifying 
  errors, exaggerations, shortcomings, and bias in Menchú's testimony. In contrast, 
  Menchú gave her testimony without notes in twenty-four hours of taped conversation 
  over an eight-day period when she was twenty-three years old, not long after 
  the murder of her father, mother, and brother and her escape to Mexico. Her 
  testimony was recorded, transcribed, reorganized, and published by Elizabeth 
  Burgos Debray, another anthropologist, who is the book's legal author (and who 
  receives the the substantial royalties the testimony has generated). In the 
  course of his research Stoll never interviewed Menchú herself. </p>
<p>Stoll begins the preface of his book by asserting that there is &quot;no doubt 
  about the most important points&quot; Menchú makes (viii). Moreover, despite 
  press reports about requests to the Nobel Prize Committee to rescind the Peace 
  Prize after the Times article, in his book Stoll states that he believes awarding 
  the Nobel Prize to Rigoberta Menchú was a &quot;good idea&quot; and that &quot;she 
  has been the first to acknowledge that she received it, not for her own accomplishments 
  but because she stands for a wider group of people who deserve international 
  support.&quot; (ix) (The prize was awarded to Menchú not for her testimony but 
  for her subsequent political work and peace organizing.) </p>
<p>Specifically, Stoll's research leads him to corroborate the following information 
  in Menchú's testimony: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Rigoberta Menchú's father was burned alive when the army attacked the Spanish 
    Embassy he was occupying to protest human rights abuses, an occurrence that 
    is widely known in Guatemala. Stoll believes Menchú¹s account of the events 
    at the embassy is more balanced than most others (80). </li>
  <li>Rigoberta Menchú's mother was detained, raped, tortured, killed, and her 
    body was mutilated by the Guatemalan army. Rigoberta Menchú's gruesome description 
    of what happened to her mother is corroborated by independent sources. (127)</li>
  <li>Rigoberta Menchú¹s 16 year-old brother Petrocino was seized, tortured, and 
    shot by the army and his mutilated body was left in the street of the town 
    of Chajul. Rigoberta Menchú reports that her brother was burned alive; Stoll 
    argues he may have been burned after he was killed, but that it ³was not rare² 
    for the army to humiliate, torture, and burn people alive in front of their 
    families. (70)</li>
  <li>Rigoberta Menchú's village, Chimel, was attacked by the army, and the villagers 
    used self-defense strategies to protect themselves, much as Menchú describes 
    (129).</li>
  <li>Rigoberta Menchú's two younger sisters did join the guerrillas after the 
    murder of their mother (130).</li>
  <li>Ladinos in the highlands near Menchú's village were, at least during the 
    war, closely associated with the army and attacks on indigenous people and 
    Menchú's family (136). </li>
  <li>Guatemalans regard Menchú's testimonial as a ³truthful portrayal of their 
    country² (246) </li>
</ol>
<p>David Stoll's research also adds information Rigoberta does not include in 
  her testimony: </p>
<ol>
  <li>The military coup in Guatemala in 1954 was &quot;organized&quot; by the 
    US government, through the CIA, to overthrow a popularly-elected government. 
    This military coup can be held directly responsible for a loss of political 
    development and the country¹s economic collapse, military violence, and the 
    revolutionary movement. Had the coup not taken place Stoll believes Guatemala 
    &quot;could have evolved in the direction of Costa Rica. which leads Latin 
    America in per capita income and political stability.&quot; (46) </li>
  <li>Rigoberta Menchú's village was completely destroyed by the Guatemalan army 
    not long after her testimony was recorded. </li>
  <li>Rigoberta Menchú's brother Victor was shot and killed by the army after 
    peacefully turning himself in. (135) </li>
  <li>Rigoberta Menchú's sister-in-law was killed and her nieces, age three and 
    five, were starved to death while in army custody. (134-6) </li>
  <li>Rigoberta Menchú's closest friend at school, Bernadina Us Hernández, was 
    killed by the army as were Bernadina¹s father, her brother (in front of the 
    family) and six other male family members (46). </li>
  <li>Stoll documents many other violent murders of innocent indigenous people 
    in the region Menchú comes from, frequently using words such as &quot;slaughter,&quot; 
    &quot;massacre,&quot; and &quot;holocaust.&quot;</li>
  <li>The international pressure that Menchú and her testimony created led, eventually, 
    to negotiation between the guerrillas and the government and a reduction in 
    the power of the army. In Stoll's words, &quot;quite an achievement.&quot; 
    (278)</li>
  <li>In the 1990s' Rigoberta Menchú had become a powerful leader for reconciliation 
    between a wide cross-section of constituencies in Guatemala and considered 
    a possible candidate for presidency of the country. </li>
</ol>
<p>There are several points which Stoll continues to dispute with Menchú's 1983 
  testimonial. Menchú herself has responded to several of these points: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Testimonies from other Guatemalan's indicate that Rigoberta Menchú's brother 
    was not burned alive (after being tortured and before being killed) and that 
    Menchú herself was not present when his body was dumped in the street outside 
    Chajul. Menchú responds that her testimony repeats the first-hand account 
    her mother gave her and that, until she is presented with the evidence of 
    her brother's body itself, she will continue to believe her mother. Independent 
    human rights records do record the public burning of indigenous people by 
    the army in Chajul at roughly the same period. (See <i>Guatemala: The Horror 
    and the Hope</i>). </li>
  <li>Based on conversations with neighbors and archives in the national land 
    office, Stoll argues that Rigoberta Menchú's father was not involved in a 
    land dispute with Ladinos but with relatives of Rigoberta Menchú's mother, 
    the Tums. Rigoberta Menchú responds that her family believed that Ladinos 
    had secretly bought the land from some of the Quiche and were using their 
    Quiche names in the dispute as a front for land they owned. While Stoll elaborates 
    disputes between indigenous Guatemalans over land, he does not mention that 
    the vast majority of land in Guatemala is in the hands of a tiny minority 
    of Ladino elite and that only 10% of rural families have enough land to live 
    on (Pratt 62, in <i>Teaching and Testimony</i>).</li>
  <li>Stoll argues that Rigoberta Menchú was a student in a junior high boarding 
    school for three years, an experience she does not mention in her 1982 account. 
    Menchú responds that she did not speak about the school in 1982 to protect 
    it from reprisals by the army. (Stoll mentions that the school was surrounded 
    at various times by the army, that students were interrogated, and that Menchú's 
    best friend at the school was killed by the army-thus making Menchú's silence 
    credible.) Menchú also explains that she was on a charity scholarship at the 
    school that only allowed her three hours of classes per day and the rest of 
    her time was spent cleaning the school as a servant.</li>
  <li>Stoll claims that Rigoberta Menchú's brother Nicholas could not have died 
    from malnutrition as she claims in her testimonial because he met her brother 
    Nicholas alive and well in Guatemala. Rigoberta explains that her father was 
    married twice and named two different sons &quot;Nicholas,&quot; a common 
    tradition among native Guatemalans. She maintains that it was the first Nicholas 
    who did, indeed, die of malnutrition.</li>
  <li>Stoll can find no evidence of the death of &quot;Petrona Chona&quot; on 
    the coffee plantation he believes that Rigoberta Menchú might have worked 
    on (Rigoberta Menchú reports Petrona Chona's killing by the landowner's son 
    when she refuses his amorous advances). Stoll does find evidence of a the 
    death of a &quot;Pascuala Xoná Chomo&quot; whose husband was accused of killing 
    her based on rumors of a relationship with the landowner's son.</li>
  <li>Stoll can find no specific evidence supporting Rigoberta Menchú's claim 
    of having worked on coffee or sugar plantations or as a maid in the capitol. 
    Aside from wondering how Menchú could have fit these activities in with everything 
    else she was doing, Stoll offers no evidence to refute Mench&uacute;'s account. 
    He corroborates that many indigenous Guatemalans do work in these plantations 
    and that Menchú's description of working conditions is accurate. Menchú describes 
    these conditions as abject, exploitative, abusive, and violent.</li>
  <li>Stoll blames the revolutionary guerrillas for the violence of the army. 
    He sites several instances where the Guatemalan army was helpful to native 
    Guatemalans, yet he doesn¹t dispute human rights reports that blame the army 
    for the murder of 100,000 innocent indigenous Guatemalans. </li>
  <li>Stoll believes that Rigoberta Menchú's testimonial portrays indigenous Guatemalans 
    as more sympathetic to the guerrilla movement than they actually were. He 
    bases his belief on interviews nearly ten years after the events Menchú describes. 
    This is a point of contention that scholars more qualified than I am respond 
    to in <i>Rigoberta Menchú, David Stoll, and the Politics of Identity</i>. 
    Yet, it seems obvious to me that after ten years of unbelievably harsh repression 
    of indigenous people by the Guatemalan army-a period during which any mention 
    of sympathy or support for guerrillas lead to almost certain death not just 
    of individuals, but also of entire families and villages-that it is not surprising 
    that Stoll does not interview many indigenous Guatemalans who tell him of 
    their support for armed rebellion. </li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, though David Stoll argues that Rigoberta Menchú &quot;romanced&quot; 
  her story to favor the guerrillas, an examination of his book and the evidence 
  on this question reveals Stoll¹s position as a matter of narrow, unbalanced, 
  and even bizarre interpretation. While Stoll raises issues that may be appropriate 
  to take up in particular classroom contexts, given Menchú's and other scholars' 
  responses to his arguments, and the minor points of factual disagreement that 
  remain, it is, frankly, hard for me to see how David Stoll's book could have 
  relevance to the vast majority of American teachers and students. An examination 
  of the controversy it stirred up might, perhaps, be useful as a study of the 
  mass media's fascination with personalities, character assassination, and its 
  failure to address fundamental social, political, historical, and economic realities. 
  In contrast is Rigoberta Menchú's testimony itself, still a most valuable classroom 
  text and resource for encountering and exploring some of the most profound and 
  disturbing realities of our time. </p>
