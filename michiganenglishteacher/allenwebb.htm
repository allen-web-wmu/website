          was a high school English teacher for six years and hold advanced certification 
          in English and Social Studies, 7-12. During that time I earned an MA

          Thirteen years in my current position, I am a full professor of English 
          at Western Michigan University focusing on English education, especially 
          the teaching of literature. At WMU I have taught the capstone courses 
          for English majors in the secondary curriculum in literature and compostion 
          pedagogy to probably around 1000 English teachers, the majority of them 
          taking positions in Michigan, as well as working with many practicing 
          teachers in our MA and Ph.D. programs. I also have taught a wide range 
          of literature courses at undergraduate and graduate levels. </font></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
          have written and published three books, one in literary studies and 
          two on teaching literature, and am working on two book projects at the 
          moment, one on doctoral education in English education and one on integrating 
          technology and the internet into English teaching. I have published 
          many articles, given zillions of conference presentations on the teaching 
          of English, and a number of times served as a conference keynote speaker.
