      public review the current standards will be reviewed by<br>
      <a href="http://www.achieve.org/">Achieve.org</a>. Who are they and what 
      might they do?</font> 
      <blockquote>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Achieve is 
          a national organization associated with the <a href="http://www.achieve.org/achieve.nsf/AmericanDiplomaProject?openform">American 
          Diploma Project</a> (ADP) and the Educational Testing Service. They 
          have been used by many states and will be used by Michigan, to review 
          state standards. </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The standards 
          that Achieve has endorsed in the past are based on <strong>grade-level-by-grade-level</strong> 
          <strong>content specificity that severely limits teacher freedom and 
          dumbs down the language arts curriculum</strong>. Achieve and the American 
          Diploma Project hold out the Indiana state standards as a model for 
          other states.</font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Good teachers 
          view their classroom as a laboratory and they experiment with what and 
          how they teach every year.  Teachers must have the freedom to change 
          content and approach to respond to their students needs, interests, 
          prior knowledge, and skills.  The proposed standards make this possible. 
          </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are 
          many things that secondary English teachers in Michigan need.  An enormous 
          morass of picayune grade-level-by-grade-level standards to slog through 
          is not one of them.  Far better are the proposed standards which, by 
          respecting teachers and students, set a far higher standard for learning.</font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The proposed 
          standards do not micromanaging the teaching in every high school English 
          classroom in the state. This is not true of the step-by-step grade level 
          content standards in Indiana that Achieve has approved which strip local 
          control from school boards, school districts, high school administrators, 
          high school English departments, and above all from the very English 
          teachers who are best equipped to make judgments about the content and 
          skills that will create high expectations for their students.  </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Support the 
          proposed standards that are NOT grade-level-by-grade-level and speak 
          out now against grade-level-by-grade-level content expectations in Michigan.</font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Asking teachers 
          to conform to elaborate grade-by-grade codified content standards that 
          someone else has created insults their professional knowledge, undermines 
          their passion, and devastates their effectiveness -- this could be insisted 
          on by Achieve and that is why the current public review of the proposed 
          standards is important.  </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Learning 
          and knowledge in secondary English language arts does not lend itself 
          to standardization.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          Content knowledge and skills in language arts do not sequence like increasingly 
          complex algebraic problems or geometric theorems.  A student who doesn’t 
          understand <i>A Tale of Two </i>Cities may become utterly engaged with 
          <i>Hamlet</i> or vice versa, and it would deaden the study of the works 
          to try to find a set of abstracted “skills” that every student who reads 
          <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> or <i>Hamlet </i>supposedly “needs to know.” 
          </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Indiana 
          Academic Standards approved by Achieve are mindlessly and mind-numbingly 
          redundant and repetitive.  For example at every grade level students 
          are expected to study Greek, Latin, and Anglo-Saxon word roots.  This 
          approach kills the joy, enthusiasm, and value of learning.   Excessively 
          codified knowledge supposedly covering all areas in secondary language 
          arts is impoverished knowledge.  Scripted language arts teaching is 
          poor teaching.  Teachers who are personally engaged with their content, 
          who are given the support and freedom to shape that content and connect 
          it to the lives of their students and the issues that matter in today’s 
          world in evolving, creative, personal, independent, unique ways are 
          teacher who will inspire their students to learn.  </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ADP and 
          Indiana Academic Standards elevate relatively trivial knowledge to a 
          high level while downplaying rich and vital content.  For example, out 
          of the 65 standards established for 9<sup>th</sup> grade, one standard 
          asks students to “analyze the way in which a work of literature is related 
          to the themes and issues of its historical period.”  This is a most 
          important and central undertaking in literature study and should rightly 
          be the focus of a great part of any language arts course.  Yet, because 
          of the creation of comprehensive standards covering all possible subjects, 
          this standard becomes 1/65 of the language arts learning that is supposed 
          to happen in the 9<sup>th</sup> grade! </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yes, there 
          are a great number of sub-skills that English teachers want their students 
          to learn.  Indeed, there is no topic in language arts that has been 
          more extensively researched over the last 100 years.  That research 
          clearly and unequivocally points to the idea that skills need to be 
          taught when the students are ready and in the context of meaningful 
          learning.  The proposed standards support that view.</font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Creating 
          comprehensive lists of every possible sub-skill and then identifying 
          grade level by grade level as to precisely when they will be taught 
          will undermine the learning of those skills.  </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ADP report 
          and the grade by grade Indiana Academic Content Standards assume a comprehensive, 
          sequential step-by-step model of learning in the English Language Arts.  
          This model is simply not appropriate to the content in question.  </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The language 
          arts is a complex field deeply connected to broad aspects of culture, 
          historical and contemporary, and involving an enormous range of non-sequential 
          skills and attitudes.  In the language arts it is not necessary for 
          every student to march through the same content or skills in order to 
          be outstandingly well prepared for college or the work place.</font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the language 
          arts a comprehensive coverage model where specific skills or content 
          knowledge is supposed to be systematically touched upon will be less 
          engaging and less meaningful than one where students go into great depth 
          and complexity with a focused look at specific skills, authors, texts 
          or themes.  Indeed, students steeped in and excited about a particular 
          subset of content or skills are likely to be MORE attractive to colleges 
          and work places than students who can march superficially through a 
          supposedly comprehensive list of abstracted skills.  </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The teaching 
          of English depends greatly on the differential prior knowledge that 
          each student brings to the classroom.  Teachers must have the freedom 
          to select content and design curriculum that moves forward from the 
          knowledge and skills of their students.  Uniform content standards in 
          language arts will most of the time constitute “dumbed down,” too difficult, 
          or irrelevant content.  </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While these 
          concerns are relevant at all grade levels, they are much more pressing 
          at the high school level where the dispersion of student preparation 
          and life experience is much greater, grade level by grade level.  While 
          it is not uncommon to find students in the sixth grade that are three 
          years behind or ahead of grade level in reading, it is all the more 
          common to find students in the eleventh grade who are six years behind 
          or ahead of grade level.  Forcing students and teachers into a standards 
          driven curriculum straight jacket will lead those who are behind to 
          become farther behind and those who are ahead to be held back.   </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Indiana 
          Academic Standards treat language arts content as fixed and non-controversial, 
          yet there is not a national consensus about either the skills or the 
          content of secondary English, or about literary or cultural knowledge 
          for that matter.  These are hotly contested areas.  English professors 
          at the finest universities are in battle over these subject areas and 
          public commentators are joining in.  It is not right, nor will it lead 
          to effective instruction, to try to bleed the life and controversy out 
          of English language arts by the creation of supposedly value neutral 
          standards.  </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While every 
          English teacher needs to make book lists, advocate student reading, 
          and help students select quality literature with personal and cultural 
          relevance, lists of state approved books that English teachers must 
          or should teach will not forward language arts learning in Michigan.  
          Dissertations could be written on the limitations of the reading list 
          that accompanies the Indiana Academic Standards.  </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ADP and 
          Indiana Academic Standards constrain secondary English teachers and 
          attempt to silence English students from joining into the controversies 
          of America’s cultural conversation when precisely what needs to be done 
          is to invite students into that conversation.  </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ADP and 
          Indiana standards do not envision an evolving, dialogic curriculum, 
          but one that is static, mechanical, and highly repetitive.  Neither 
          “politically correct” nor “politically neutral” approaches should be 
          foisted onto Michigan students.  Instead, teachers and students must 
          be free to explore controversial materials in ways that are sensitive 
          and contextualized to local students, classrooms, and communities.  
          </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The real 
          secret to education in any field, and especially in the language arts, 
          is the passion of the teacher to teach content that they love and know 
          about.  The kind of comprehensive, narrowly conceived grade-level-by-grade-level 
          content standards adopted by the state of Indiana and held out as a 
          model for Michigan will undermine the passion and commitment of the 
          teacher to the content.  The kind of content standard envisioned by 
          ADP and Indiana is devastating to learning in the language arts.</font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The grade 
          level content standards that Achieve envisions are clearly a prelude 
          to state grade-level-by-grade-level MEAP testing.  Grade-level-by-grade-level 
          standardized testing will not improve language arts education in Michigan.  
          The fact that evidence is mounting nationwide on this topic is indicated 
          by the failure of congress to pass President Bush’s NCLB for high schools, 
          even though it was supposedly the highest domestic priority of the administration.  
          </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why should 
          we in Michigan rush ahead on an agenda that is clearly failing nation 
          wide?  If you examine the ADP website you will see that Michigan currently 
          rates ABOVE the average of other states on all of their indicators of 
          school success and ABOVE Indiana in terms of number of students graduating 
          from high school.  </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In schools 
          and classrooms the focus on mind-numbing and stultifying grade-level-by-grade-level 
          standards and testing wastes valuable instructional time and turns students 
          off of the value of learning.  Believe me, it is the rare high school 
          student who is motivated to learn because he or she wants to do well 
          on a standardized test.  To repeat, students are motivated to learn 
          by teachers who are passionate and knowledgeable about their subject 
          and by teachers who respect them as learners.  </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In creating 
          standards like those in ADP or Indiana we will not be respecting the 
          teachers as knowledgeable about their content area and skillful at teaching, 
          we will, in fact, be profoundly undermining them.  Just as students 
          are not motivated to learn because they are told that something will 
          be on a standardized test, so teachers are not motivated to teach when 
          someone else, someone working through the Michigan Department of Education, 
          for example, tells them what their discipline is or what or how they 
          should teach it.  </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If Michigan 
          wants to set a standard for the nation, if the legislature and the governor 
          want to create a system of education to be a national model, lets help 
          them put forward ways to truly support secondary English teachers and 
          students. Ways that go beyond creating standards!</font></p>
