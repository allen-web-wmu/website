      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">New standards and curriculum 
        expectations for high school English in Michigan have been released by 
        the Michigan Department of Education in May 2006</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These high school standards 
        are some of the finest language arts standards in the United States. They 
        reflect research and best practice in language arts content and instruction. 
        They protect teacher decision making and are not narrow, highly restrictive, 
        grade-level-by-grade-level standards being forced on teachers and students 
        in many states by No Child Left Behind. The standards do not include a 
        list of required readings for every student. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the words of the opening 
        of the document, these standards are &quot;intended to support conversations 
        at the school and district level.&quot; They are &quot;comprehensive&quot; 
        though &quot;not meant to be used as a proportional guide to curriculum 
        development... teachers are not expected to spend equal time on each standard.&quot; 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The high school standards are 
        available at: <a href="standards.pdf">MDE High School Language Arts Standards</a>. 
        Michigan <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/documents/ELAGLCE_140483_7.pdf">K-8 
        Language Arts Standards</a> are also on line. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Michigan English teachers need 
        to follow closely current debates in the state senate that may lead to 
        not only four years of required English (a good idea) but also required 
        courses and specific mandated, grade-level-by-grade-level curriculum for 
        each grade level (a bad idea). </font></p>

        standards, </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="reallyneed.htm">What 
        do secondary English teachers really want?</a></font></p>
