      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Webb,</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BRAVO!!! I wish you all the 
          luck in the world putting this thing together. It sounds like what is 
          coming may be a nightmare. <br>
          <br>
          I first taught in Texas in the late 80s when everyone was on the same 
          page. I left at semester break because I simply couldn't do that. Now 
          I am reaching the end of my career and it is rearing its ugly head again. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At my high school last August 
          on the first day of school, our principal informed us that we would 
          all teach the same skills, the same content, the same test on the same 
          day. I thought I had moved back to Texas. I asked him what his reasoning 
          was and he said it was NCLB and EdYES that required this. We did not 
          take this sitting down and called MDE for clarification. They told us 
          this was not what was intended. Nevertheless, we were given this same 
          directive again this spring at our last department meeting -- that we 
          should all do the same thing each and every day. It has taken the wind 
          out of our teaching as you suggest.<br>
          <br>
          I am sure I am not alone in this situation. It appalls me that we are 
          returning to an out-dated, obviously poor model, that is sure to have 
          little success. Students are not cookie cutters, and neither are we. 
          It is ridiculous to imagine that English is like math or science. Although 
          the skills do build on each other, no one has ever asked me what a gerund 
          was since my last linguistics class. As for outside the educational 
          world, I have never been asked. It is not as if foreshadowing and its 
          nuances are a topic of everyday conversatoin, but it is part of what 
          makes a good scary movie. Most people would be able to identify the 
          characteristics of foreshadowing in story and film, but may not be able 
          to identify for term itself. Unlike in math where 2 and 2 are always 
          4, it is not necessary to memorize the terms but to become immersed 
          in them and learn to love literature.<br>
          <br>
          I did not mean to rant but this is an issue that has been near and dear 
          to me for all of my teaching life. If I can help in any specific way, 
          please let me know.</font></p>
