      <p><font size="+2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What is happening?</font> 
      </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Currently a group of five college 
        professors and one high school teacher are being paid by the Michigan 
        Department of Education to decide what every teacher will teach and what 
        every child will learn in every high school English classroom in the state 
        from the 9th to the 12th grade. This group holds its first meetings in 
        Lansing June 16 &amp;17.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From Allen Webb's Letter to 
        the Committee, June 9:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are 
          told that the American Diploma Project (ADP) and the academic standards 
          of the State of Indiana will serve as models for our work.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Proceeding 
          to create grade level content standards for high school Language Arts, 
          the focus for this committee, without examining the fundamental assumptions 
          that underlie the ADP report that is supposed to guide our work would 
          be irresponsible and unprofessional.  We need to stop and ask what will 
          be the effect of the standards it is proposed we create on the learning 
          of students in language arts classes in Michigan?</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The thesis 
          of the American Diploma Project (ADP) is that the problem with American 
          education is that high school diplomas do not indicate that students 
          are prepared for success in college or work.  Yet, even their own data 
          does not bear out their conclusions.  The problem is clearly not that 
          ALL diplomas are meaningless.   </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Michigan 
          the problem is not that the public schools have low standards.  The 
          problem is that in key areas, especially low income areas in the inner 
          cities and some rural areas, students are not given enough help to overcome 
          the handicaps they face and they fall farther and farther behind until 
          they drop out in enormous numbers.  No wonder these students are alienated 
          from our public schools.  These are the children who are “left behind” 
          and their situation rightly should be the focus of our and public attention.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Research 
          shows that what these students need is smaller school settings, more 
          personal connection with teachers and schools, and more support to meet 
          the teachers and schools’ expectations.  To achieve these goals means 
          that schools for poor and low income students need more resources, more 
          teachers, smaller classes, more support personnel.  Why should it be 
          a mystery to anyone in a democracy that schools serving students from 
          low socioeconomic groups need MORE resources than school serving wealthy 
          students, yet, of course, they receive LESS -- and the problem further 
          compounds.  </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Legislators 
          and policy makers may think they can paper over this reality with “quick 
          fix” and “inexpensive” standards and testing, but despite what the testing 
          companies who stand to profit claim, the research is clear that such 
          supposedly “cheap” efforts will worsen the situation for those “left 
          behind”  and bring down the quality of education for all students.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yes, there 
          are schools, and tracks within schools, where standards need to be higher.  
          The ADP project is not completely wrong about that.  But simply legislating 
          one size fits all standards, for all students, in all schools, particularly 
          “fine grained” “year-by-year” content standards, will lead to MORE SCHOOL 
          FAILURE, not less.  Sadly it is not even cynical to remark that having 
          the public schools fail is an intended goal for some of the framers 
          of NCLB who want charter, religious, and private schools instead.  (Why 
          else set average yearly progress standards that are, in fact, statistically 
          impossible for any school to meet in the long run?  Moreover, the record 
          on charter schools is poor (especially in Michigan which has gone ahead 
          and authorized charter schools willy-nilly) – they are not going to 
          “raise standards” either.))  It is not gratuitous that I link ADP and 
          NCLB; they are based on the same premises and approaches... ]</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are 
          meaningful models of content standards in Language Arts.  Those models 
          specifically reject grade level content standards and fine grained content 
          and skill analysis.  </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In fact, 
          Michigan already has sound content standards for the English language 
          arts!  The existing Michigan language arts content standards and benchmarks 
          were developed over several years with the involvement of a number of 
          classroom teachers. There are ten standards with 43 different specific 
          benchmarks for content knowledge and skills at the high school level.  
          High school level language arts is coordinated with lower grade levels.  
          The existing standards are enough without trying to further hamstring 
          teachers.  In Indiana there are 65 standards for the 9<sup>th</sup> 
          grade language arts alone!  Talk about deadening education with an overload 
          of scripted specificity!  </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Michigan’s 
          existing standards are similar to, though more detailed and specific 
          than the standards created by the National Council of the Teachers of 
          English and the International Reading Association.  These two enormous 
          language arts teacher organizations with over 140,000 members and to 
          which ALL of the leading researchers in the field of language arts education 
          in American belong, worked closely together for years to develop standards 
          that were sufficiently focused to give guidance and create high expectations 
          and, yet, sufficiently open to facilitate the kind of freedom that teachers 
          and students need to excel.  </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Michigan’s 
          existing standards, modeled on NCTE and IRA approaches, demonstrate 
          an understanding of language arts education and draw on efforts by leading 
          researchers and scholars to create effective, workable, and high achieving 
          standards.  Our state’s standards should not be bull dozed by us or 
          by politicians or bureaucrats in the Michigan Department of Education 
          eager to jump on a bandwagon that has already gone by, with results 
          that will be crippling for education in Michigan.  </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Micromanaging 
          the teaching in every high school English classroom in the state is 
          not and should not be the function of our committee, the state legislature, 
          the Michigan Department of Education or the governor’s office.  The 
          step-by-step grade level content standards in Indiana that are proposed 
          as a model for Michigan strip local control from school boards, school 
          districts, high school administrators, high school English departments, 
          and above all from the very English teachers who are best equipped to 
          make judgments about the content and skills that will create high expectations 
          for their students.    </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Asking teachers 
          to conform to elaborate grade-by-grade codified content standards that 
          someone else has created insults their professional knowledge, undermines 
          their passion, and devastates their effectiveness.  The problem is not 
          lack of standards.  The problem is, or will be, the imposition of standards.  
          As an expert in this field, I tell you with confidence that learning 
          and knowledge in secondary English language arts does not lend itself 
          to standardization.</font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The very 
          idea that a committee of five college professors and one public school 
          teacher, no matter how eager or how well-qualified, will, in two months 
          time, create grade-level-by-grade-level content standards for every 
          high school English class and every high school language arts student 
          in the state of Michigan is, in itself, absurd, appalling, and undemocratic.  
          </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Indiana 
          Academic Standards that we are told is our model is mindlessly and mind-numbingly 
          redundant and repetitive.  For example at every grade level students 
          are expected to study Greek, Latin, and Anglo-Saxon word roots.  This 
          approach kills the joy, enthusiasm, and value of learning.   Excessively 
          codified knowledge supposedly covering all areas in secondary language 
          arts is impoverished knowledge.  Scripted language arts teaching is 
          poor teaching.  Teachers who are personally engaged with their content, 
          who are given the support and freedom to shape that content and connect 
          it to the lives of their students and the issues that matter in today’s 
          world in evolving, creative, personal, independent, unique ways are 
          teacher who will inspire their students to learn.  </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ADP and 
          Indiana Academic Standards elevate relatively trivial knowledge to a 
          high level while downplaying rich and vital content.  For example, out 
          of the 65 standards established for 9<sup>th</sup> grade, one standard 
          asks students to “analyze the way in which a work of literature is related 
          to the themes and issues of its historical period.”  This is a most 
          important and central undertaking in literature study and should rightly 
          be the focus of a great part of any language arts course.  Yet, because 
          of the creation of comprehensive standards covering all possible subjects, 
          this standard becomes 1/65 of the language arts learning that is supposed 
          to happen in the 9<sup>th</sup> grade! </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yes, there 
          are a great number of sub-skills that English teachers want their students 
          to learn.  Indeed, there is no topic in language arts that has been 
          more extensively researched over the last 100 years.  That research 
          clearly and unequivocally points to the idea that skills need to be 
          taught when the students are ready and in the context of meaningful 
          learning.  </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Creating 
          comprehensive lists of every possible sub-skill and then identifying 
          grade level by grade level as to precisely when they will be taught 
          will undermine the learning of those skills.  Michigan’s existing content 
          standards provide an appropriate, flexible, and intellectually defensible 
          framework to support Michigan’s teachers in their efforts to provide 
          students with language arts skills. </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Indiana 
          Academic Standards treat language arts content as fixed and non-controversial, 
          yet there is not a national consensus about either the skills or the 
          content of secondary English, or about literary or cultural knowledge 
          for that matter.  These are hotly contested areas.  English professors 
          at the finest universities are in battle over these subject areas and 
          public commentators are joining in.  It is not right, nor will it lead 
          to effective instruction, to try to bleed the life and controversy out 
          of English language arts by the creation of supposedly value neutral 
          standards.  </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While every 
          English teacher needs to make book lists, advocate student reading, 
          and help students select quality literature with personal and cultural 
          relevance, lists of state approved books that English teachers must 
          or should teach will not forward language arts learning in Michigan.  
          Dissertations could be written on the limitations of the reading list 
          that accompanies the Indiana Academic Standards.  </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ADP and 
          Indiana Academic Standards constrain secondary English teachers and 
          attempt to silence English students from joining into the controversies 
          of America’s cultural conversation when precisely what needs to be done 
          is to invite students into that conversation.  </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ADP and 
          Indiana standards do not envision an evolving, dialogic curriculum, 
          but one that is static, mechanical, and highly repetitive.  Neither 
          “politically correct” nor “politically neutral” approaches should be 
          foisted onto Michigan students.  Instead, teachers and students must 
          be free to explore controversial materials in ways that are sensitive 
          and contextualized to local students, classrooms, and communities.  
          </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Speaking 
          as professor of English, and I can assure you that almost any professor 
          of English would agree, the standards that Indiana has adopted are sophomoric; 
          they are the work of people who truly do not understand the content 
          and discipline of English as well as they should, but, acting as “wise 
          fools” they are willing to tell others what to do. </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are far 
          smarter than that in Michigan.  In Michigan we greatly value the expertise 
          of those in the academic disciplines (in our state all secondary students 
          must major in the content area of English and the professors of English 
          education are content area specialists usually in English departments).  
          Indeed, by any measure, Michigan is one of the nation’s leaders in English 
          education.  Heaven forbid we copy cat an inferior approach.</font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Good teachers 
          view their classroom as a laboratory and they experiment with what and 
          how they teach every year.  Teachers must have the freedom to change 
          content and approach to respond to their students needs, interests, 
          prior knowledge, and skills.  Supporting that kind of freedom should 
          be the task of our committee and the educational and political leaders 
          of the state.  </font></p>
