        There is drama in the mountains. They call me to them, and, when I depart, 
        like all climbers, I am enriched with stories. This page briefly introduces 
        some of those stories. The thumbnails below -- and the full size pictures 
        you can see by clicking on them -- hint at the mountain scene.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Mountains 
        have many routes coming into season at different times of the year. The 
        first mountain I ever climbed was Mt. Hood (11,235'), a peak I could see 
        from my bedroom window in Portland, Oregon. Spectacular year round -- 
        I have climbed Mt. Hood 25 times from all sides in Spring, Summer, Fall, 
        and Winter. <a href="images/hood1.gif"><img src="images/hood1thumb.gif" width="150" height="92" border="0" align="left"></a>Although 
        it is one of the most frequently climbed glaciated mountains in the world, 
        most climbers attempt only the South Side. This picture shows the lesser 
        known &quot;North Side.&quot; From left to right I have ascended the North 
        Face Cleaver, Elliot Headwall, Sunshine, and the Coe Glacier. The glacier 
        on the left side, the Elliot, is a late summer playground for ice climbing--also 
        the site of my worst accident, a swan dive into a 100+' deep crevasse; thank goodness I landed on a clump of snow stuck in the crevasse's throat, only 40' down.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Another peak 
        that I could see from my house was Mt. St. Helens. <a href="images/sthelens.jpg"><img src="images/sthelensthumb.gif" width="150" height="169" border="0" align="right"></a>In 
        the foreground is Spirit Lake where I attended Boy Scout camp --utterly 
        transformed by the 1980 volcanic eruption. While the explosion filled 
        the sky over Portland and dropped a thick coat of ash on the city, it 
        was only later I learned that two friends were killed taking pictures 
        between the lake and the mountain. I climbed the old St. Helens three 
        times by different routes from the side you can see here. I remember my first 
        climb of St. Helens -- all night to reach the top for the sunrise with my friend Blair 
        Harcourt. Exhausted, both of us feel asleep on the summit.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The Cascades 
        are a spectacular range and I have summited most of them. <a href="images/jefferson.jpg"><img src="images/jeffersonthumb.gif" width="150" height="113" border="0" align="left"></a>Mt. 
        Jefferson is the second highest peak in Oregon surrounded by the Warm 
        Springs Indian Reservation and a gorgeous wilderness area. Glacier travel, 
        steep snow traverses and a rock pinnacle make even the easiest routes 
        on Jeff challenging. On one climb of Jefferson I had left a bottle of 
        Guiness Stout in a snowbank at the base camp. It was cold and delicious 
        when I returned. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><a href="images/southsister.jpg"><img src="images/southsisterthumb.jpg" width="150" height="101" border="0" align="right"></a>The 
        Three Sisters are a familiar sight in the Oregon Cascades. This picture 
        of the most climbed peak in the group, South Sister, shows the rarely 
        attempted north side. On the right is an ice route called &quot;Silver 
        Couloir&quot; that I climbed with Craig Henry and Dave Holmberg. By the 
        way, the lenticular cloud in this picture is an ominous sign the weather 
        is about to change -- climbers, think twice before going on.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">This mountain 
        is one of the most photographed in the world -- though many might not know 
        it by name as &quot;Mt. Shuksan&quot; in the North Cascades of Washington 
        State. <a href="images/shuksan.jpg"><img src="images/shuksanthumb.gif" width="150" height="93" border="0" align="left"></a>The 
        climb I made by the Fisher Chimney route was every bit as spectacular 
        as the picture promises. As assistant leader I incurred the wrath of the 
        leader Lath Flanagan when, with signals crossed and night descending, 
        I led half the party off of the mountain before the rest had caught up. 
        Back in base camp with no word from the leader and missing members, at 
        2:00 am we began to put together a rescue team. Just as we started off, 
        Flanagan and the rest stumbled, exhausted to the tents. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><a href="images/rainier.jpg"><img src="images/rainierthumb.gif" width="150" height="113" border="0" align="right"></a>Mt. 
        Rainier (14,410') is the king of the Cascades. It is hard to appreciate 
        the size of mountains, even when you have climbed them many times. Mt. 
        Rainier is enormous, with the largest glacial system of any peak in the 
        US outside of Alaska. I have started up the mountain five times and made 
        the summit only twice. One successful climb was the &quot;Fuhrer's Finger&quot; 
        a direct line that runs about straight up the middle of this picture. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The North 
        West includes mountains other than the Cascades. One of the most beautiful 
        is Mt. Olympus. <a href="images/olympus.jpg"><img src="images/olympusthumb.jpg" width="150" height="100" align="left" border="0"></a>The 
        Olympic National Park protects <em>the only significant stand of old growth 
        temperate rainforest in the contiguous United States</em>. The merciless timber 
        industry has taken the rest, don't let anyone fool you about that. This 
        picture of Olympus shows the Blue Glacier. Once, carefully roped crossing 
        the heavily crevassed glacier, I saw a large wolf trotting by about 200 
        yards below us.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><a href="images/pisco.jpg"><img src="images/piscothumb.gif" width="150" height="100" align="left" border="0"></a>I 
        have summited two peaks in the Cordillera Blanca of the Peruvian Andes, 
        <a href="http://www.peakware.com/encyclopedia/peaks/addapeak120.htm">Pisco</a> 
        (over 19,000)' on the left, and <a href="http://www.peakware.com/encyclopedia/peaks/addapeak512.htm">Tocllaraju</a> 
        (over 20,000') on the right. <a href="images/tocllaraju.jpg"><img src="images/tocllaraju1thumb.gif" width="150" height="103" border="0" align="right"></a>Each 
        climb required five days past villages, across glaciers, with high camps 
        in magnificent spots. As our party reached the long ridge on Pisco (above) 
        spectacular peaks suddenly came into view. At the same moment, a dense low cloud 
        blew over just above us; it felt as if I could just reach up and put my 
        hands inside it.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><a href="images/mountain.jpg"><img src="images/mountainthumb.gif" width="150" height="98" border="0" align="left"></a>My 
        greatest mountaineering accomplishment was as a member of the 1982 <a href="http://www.peakware.com/peaks.html?pk=252">Tirich 
        Mir</a> Expedition. The highest peak in the Hindu Kush range of the Himalayas, 
        Tirich Mir is in Northwest Pakistan, on the Afghan border. 25,253' high, 
        it is a massive mountain and significant objective. (There are only 14 peaks in the world  over 26,000'.) <a href="images/tirichmir.jpg"><img src="images/tirichmirthumb.jpg" alt="tirich mir" width="150" height="76" border="0" align="right"></a>This 
        six week expedition involved fifty low elevation porters and eight climbers, 
        Bob Wilson (leader), John Smolich (asst. leader), Lath Flanagan (physician), 
        Dennis Olmstead, Tom Gordon, Terry Jones, John Dasler, and myself -- the 
        team's youngest climber. We were all members of the Portland-based <a href="http://www.mazamas.org">Mazama 
        Mountaineering Club</a>. <a href="images/tirichmir.jpg"></a>With 
        the support of the whole team, four of us made the summit, John, John, 
        Dennis, and I. We believe that <a href="tirichmirroute.jpg"><img src="images/tirichmirroutethumb.jpg" alt="tirich mir route" width="140" height="105" border="0" align="left" usemap="#Map2"></a>we were the first Americans to climb Tirich 
        Mir. We established four high camps above base, spent weeks roped up crossing 
        glaciers, put up 2000' of fixed line, climbed a hard, ice covered overhanging 
        chimney, and came home without serious accident or injury.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Tirich Mir 
        marked a turning point, a fork in the road that led me away from ever 
        higher summits. My partners John Smolich, John Dasler, and Alan Pennington 
        went on, forming the core of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_K2_disaster">ambitious attempt on K2</a>'s unclimbed &quot;magic 
        line.&quot; Alan and John Smolich perished there in an enormous avalanche 
        in 1986. (The story is told in Jim Curran's <i><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=3f4QxH0aknwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=K2,+Triumph+and+Tragedy&source=bl&ots=RkSdi0hW2K&sig=cD6YKExOaddnXfYBT-JEgELK9uE&hl=en&ei=xvKETIfAMcLenAfvqKWXAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false">K2, Triumph and Tragedy</a> </i>-- a 
        book that sets the stage for Hollywood's &quot;Vertical Limit.&quot;)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">I never went 
        to the mountains to risk injury or death. Instead, I sought there startling 
        beauty, a free range for physical and emotional exuberance, and joyful, 
        serious play with dear friends. </font></p>
