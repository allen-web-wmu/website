<em><a class="wiki_link" href="God%27s%20Bits%20of%20Wood.html">God's Bits of Wood</a></em> by Sembene Ousmane is the story of the railway workers as the strike against the oppressive French colonialists.

<em><a class="wiki_link" href="Kaffir%20Boy.html">Kaffir Boy</a></em> by Mark Mathabane is the true story of a black boy growing up in Apartheid South Africa. Mark Mathabane tells his story from the age of four to eighteen, specifically relaying his family's struggle to survive and his own struggle to get an education. Students will likely be profoundly affected by the consequences of a policy of racial separation on all of the people, both black and white, in South Africa. This novel would be appropriate for grades 10-12 in a secondary English classroom, and would also be an excellent addition to a history class. It would be interesting to pair this text with <em><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&amp;EAN=9780743262170&amp;itm=3" rel="nofollow">Cry, the Beloved Country </a></em>by Alan Paton or narratives by Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, and other advocates for racial equality. by <a class="wiki_link" href="Builders.html">Lindsay Steenbergen</a><br />

<em><a class="wiki_link" href="Nervous%20Conditions.html">Nervous Conditions</a></em> by Tsitsi Dangarembga is a poignant novel about young Tambu from Rhodesia and her coming of age in post-colonial Africa. The story is driven by Tambu's desire for an education while the subtext focuses on the dichotomy between the traditional African woman and the modern, westernized African woman. Throughout the story, Tambu observes, questions and reflects upon others around her, especially her cousin Nyasha, and in doing so, learns much about her culture and herself. This novel is appropriate for the upper-secondary and post-secondary classroom, and completely fitting for classrooms outside the English discipline, including Women's Studies, Anthropology, Ethics, and/or Social Studies. The following article looks carefully at the challenges of bringing this novel into the classroom and offers some resources and ideas for doing so. by <a class="wiki_link" href="Builders.html">Nicole Ziegler</a><br />

<em><a class="wiki_link" href="The%20Palm-Wine%20Drinkard.html">The Palm-Wine Drinkard</a></em> by Amos Tutuola<br />
This is the story of his fantastic adventures. It reads like a folk tale and has a simple and artless style that is very effective. Warning: this text, although suitable for high school students, has its challenges due to an eccentric style of writing. by <a class="wiki_link" href="Builders.html">Peter VanGorp</a><br />
