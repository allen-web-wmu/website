<em>Cool Salsa</em> is one of my favorite finds from browsing the Spanish language section at Barnes and Noble. It's a $5 collection of poems in a small paperback, and it includes pieces by YA authors including Sandra Cisneros (author of <em>The House on Mango Street) ,</em> Cristina Moreno, Luis J. Rodriguez (author of <em>Always Running),</em> Gary Soto, Ana Castillo, and Judith Ortiz Cofer (author of <em>An Island Like You</em>). All of the poems are written in both English and Spanish, with a note as to the language of the original piece as well as the translator. There is also a glossary of &quot;untranslatable&quot; slang, as well as cities and people referenced, in the back of the book. Finally, the book contains a brief description about each of the twenty-nine authors included. It's worth the $5 purchase! <em>by</em> <a class="wiki_link" href="Builders.html">Lindsay Steenbergen</a><br />
