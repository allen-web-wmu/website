  <p><b><font size="4">Toward a Multicultural, Postcolonial British Literature</font></b></p>
  <p align="left">For too long British literature as been taught as an isolated 
    national tradition. Yet, British literature can also be perceived as a dynamic 
    dialogue between the traditions, history, language, and culture of the world's 
    most influential imperial power and the enormous diversity of its colonial 
    possessions around the world. This page suggests a few texts and ideas for 
    teachers beginning to explore a truly multicultural, postcolonial approach 
    to teaching British literature. </p>

<p align="center"><b>English Works to Pair with Texts from the British Empire 
  </b></p>
<p><i>Utopia</i> (1516) by Thomas Moore is based on accounts of the New World 
  from the Vespucci expeditions. A fascinating imaginative work to compare with 
  both European and Native American societies, inspires debate and interesting 
  creative projects. (Dover Thrift $1.50.) </p>
<p><i>The Tempest</i> (1611) by William Shakespeare is at the center of a rich 
  discussion about colonialism and cultural encounter. Drawing on early accounts 
  of the Virginia colonies, Prospero and Caliban have come to be regarded as emblematic 
  figures of European and native relations. (See my article ³A Multicultural Tempest,² 
  English Journal, April 1993) (Dover $1.50.) Compare to: First chapter of A People¹s 
  History of the United States (Howard Zinn); ³Of Cannibals² contemporary essay 
  by Montaigne, read by Shakespeare; and, Strachey Letter--Letter from the Virginia 
  colonies on which the play was based. </p>
<p><i>Oroonoko</i> (1688) the first novel written in English--and written by a 
  woman. Drawing on her voyage to the Caribbean Aphra Behn tells the story of 
  an African prince taken into slavery who rebels against his masters. </p>
<p><i>Robinson Crusoe</i> (1719) by Daniel Defoe is one of the most popular classics, 
  read, it is said, by every young man that ever went into service in the British 
  empire. Interesting study of an Englishman bringing order and civilization to 
  the ³savages² and the ³untamed² New World. (Dover $2.00.) Compare to: Foe by 
  TM Coetze (1986) experimental fiction by South African writer, author of Waiting 
  for the Barbarians. </p>
<p><i>Olahdah Equiano</i> (1789) an amazing slave narrative that is a work of 
  English literature (published in England by an English citizen). Would make 
  a rich comparison with The Tempest, Oronoko, Robinson Crusoe, etc. (Dover $2.00) 
</p>
<p>³A Modest Proposal² by Jonathan Swift is set in England¹s oldest colony, Ireland, 
  and is a critique of English absentee landlords. </p>
<p><i>Jane Eyre</i> by Charlotte Bronte has a fascinating colonial connection 
  through Rochester¹s Caribbean plantations and wife, Bertha Mason. Many other 
  19th Century novels have similar interesting colonial connections, consider 
  Magwitch in Great Expectations, Mr. Micawber in David Cooperfield, Heathcliff 
  in Wuthering Heights or even the Bertran estate funded by Antigua plantations 
  in Mansfield Park.. Compare to: Wide Sargasso Sea Jean Rhys; Abeng, Michelle 
  Cliff </p>
<p><i>Heart of Darkness</i> (1899) by Joseph Conrad is most meaningful when read 
  in the context of European colonialism. (Dover $1.00) Many other works by Conrad 
  explore colonial themes. Compare to: ³Racism in Heart of Darkness² by Chinua 
  Achebe (see Norton Edition); Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe, and many other 
  postcolonial texts. </p>
<p><i>Passage to India</i> by E.M. Forster treats the arrogance of British colonialism 
  in India. Students may find the film more approachable than the novel. </p>
<p><i>Kim</i> (1901) by Rudyard Kipling addresses the ³Great Game² of British 
  and Russian struggle for control over India. Many other works by Kipling would 
  fit perfectly into such a course, including Plain Tales of the Hills, Gunga 
  Din and Other Poems (Dover $1.00), Man Who Would Be King (Dover $1.50). </p>
<p>³Shooting an Elephant² by George Orwell set in the British colony of Burma 
  is an excellent essay on the role of the English as colonial administrators. 
</p>
<p><i>Lord of the Flies</i> by William Golding can also be seen as a work in the 
  colonial tradition and makes an interesting comparison with Robinson Crusoe 
  and Heart of Darkness. Compare to: Jonsilver(?) a truly disturbing colonial 
  version of Lord of the Flies with girls instead of boys; Coral Island British 
  adventure story mentioned in and critiqued by Lord of the Flies; The Island 
  of Dr. Moreau by H.G. Wells, a colonial story and could be read along with several 
  of the classic British works. (Dover $1.50.) </p>
