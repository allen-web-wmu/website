          Standards <br>
          for the English Language Arts</font></font></h1>
        <p align="left">The vision guiding these standards is that all students 
          must have the opportunities and resources to develop the language skills 
          they need to pursue life's goals and to participate fully as informed, 
          productive members of society. These standards assume that literacy 
          growth begins before children enter school as they experience and experiment 
          with literacy activities&#8212;reading and writing, and associating 
          spoken words with their graphic representations. Recognizing this fact, 
          these standards encourage the development of curriculum and instruction 
          that make productive use of the emerging literacy abilities that children 
          bring to school. Furthermore, the standards provide ample room for the 
          innovation and creativity essential to teaching and learning. They are 
          not prescriptions for particular curriculum or instruction. Although 
          we present these standards as a list, we want to emphasize that they 
          are not distinct and separable; they are, in fact, interrelated and 
          should be considered as a whole. </p>
        <p align="left">1. Students read a wide range of print and non-print texts 
          to build an understanding of texts, of themselves, and of the cultures 
          of the United States and the world; to acquire new information; to respond 
          to the needs and demands of society and the workplace; and for personal 
          fulfillment. Among these texts are fiction and nonfiction, classic and 
          contemporary works.<br>
          <br>
          2. Students read a wide range of literature from many periods in many 
          genres to build an understanding of the many dimensions (e.g., philosophical, 
          ethical, aesthetic) of human experience.<br>
          <br>
          3. Students apply a wide range of strategies to comprehend, interpret, 
          evaluate, and appreciate texts. They draw on their prior experience, 
          their interactions with other readers and writers, their knowledge of 
          word meaning and of other texts, their word identification strategies, 
          and their understanding of textual features (e.g., sound-letter correspondence, 
          sentence structure, context, graphics).<br>
          <br>
          4. Students adjust their use of spoken, written, and visual language 
          (e.g., conventions, style, vocabulary) to communicate effectively with 
          a variety of audiences and for different purposes.<br>
          <br>
          5. Students employ a wide range of strategies as they write and use 
          different writing process elements appropriately to communicate with 
          different audiences for a variety of purposes.<br>
          <br>
          6. Students apply knowledge of language structure, language conventions 
          (e.g., spelling and punctuation), media techniques, figurative language, 
          and genre to create, critique, and discuss print and non-print texts.<br>
          <br>
          7. Students conduct research on issues and interests by generating ideas 
          and questions, and by posing problems. They gather, evaluate, and synthesize 
          data from a variety of sources (e.g., print and non-print texts, artifacts, 
          people) to communicate their discoveries in ways that suit their purpose 
          and audience.<br>
          <br>
          8. Students use a variety of technological and information resources 
          (e.g., libraries, databases, computer networks, video) to gather and 
          synthesize information and to create and communicate knowledge.<br>
          <br>
          9. Students develop an understanding of and respect for diversity in 
          language use, patterns, and dialects across cultures, ethnic groups, 
          geographic regions, and social roles.<br>
          <br>
          10. Students whose first language is not English make use of their first 
          language to develop competency in the English language arts and to develop 
          understanding of content across the curriculum.<br>
          <br>
          11. Students participate as knowledgeable, reflective, creative, and 
          critical members of a variety of literacy communities.<br>
          <br>
          12. Students use spoken, written, and visual language to accomplish 
          their own purposes (e.g., for learning, enjoyment, persuasion, and the 
          exchange of information).</p>
