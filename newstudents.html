      <p>Welcome to the WMU English major in the secondary education curriculum. Our program is one of the largest in the United States, and, 
        we like to think, one of the finest. The program combines a major in English, 
        course work in the College of Education, specific secondary English methods 
        courses (English 4800, Teaching Literature in the Secondary Schools; English 
        4790 Teaching Writing in the Secondary Schools, and English 5740 Grammar and the 
        Teaching of Grammar), and pre-internships and internships in the public schools. 
        Our graduates have are well-prepared and successful on the job market. Our English 
        education program is closely connected to teachers in the field. We offer MA 
        and Ph.D. degrees to practicing English teachers and we sponsor an outstanding 
        teacher institute, the Third Coast Writing Project.
      <p>Students in this program should become student members of the National Council 
        of the Teachers of English and subscribe to the excellent publication <i>English 
          Journal.</i> NCTE has special student rates, and hosts conferences around the 
        country to which English education students are welcome. You can learn more 
        about NCTE and become a member at their web site: <a href="http://www.ncte.org">www.ncte.org</a>.
      <p>Dr. Allen 0Webb has created a web site for WMU English majors in the secondary 
        education curriculum that has lots of useful information, resources, course 
        syllabi, and advice for aspiring teachers: <a href="index.html">www.allenwebb.net</a>. 
      <p>State-of-the-art English teaching is increasingly integrated with the internet 
        and information technology. The WMU secondary English education program has 
        a wireless, laptop classroom where these new approaches to teaching are explored. 
        All students in our program are expected to develop interactive teaching portfolio 
        websites (<a href="engl480websites.html">samples</a>).
      <p>Degree requirements and further information about the program are available 
        at the WMU English Department web site: <a href="http://www.wmich.edu/english">www.wmich.edu/english</a>.
