        </font><font color="#000000">From: JJoh817194@aol.com<br>
        </font><font color="#000000">To: allen.webb@wmich.edu <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Dear Allen, </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">I hope you haven't forgotten me! Jackie Johnson. 
        (Tall, confused black girl!) :) I intern taught at Loy Norrix High School? 
        Yeah, me! How are you? </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">I'm not doing so well. I'm down here in Greensboro, 
        North Carolina, teaching at Lincoln Middle School. I have seventh graders. 
        I teach Language Arts and Social Studies (yes, they stuck me with an area 
        I know absolutely nothing about!). </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">I got my wish...I'm teaching in the inner city. 
        The school is in one of the worst areas in the city. Our students population 
        is 97% minority. The faculty is 98% minority. I enjoy working with my 
        students and I love my colleagues. The principal, Mr. Hash, is okay. He's 
        a push-over, but he loves people... especially our "exceptional" children 
        at Lincoln. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Despite the fact that I enjoy living here in the 
        south where it's nice and warm, I hate teaching. I don't like using that 
        word but I do feel that strongly about my career choice. It's too much 
        work. I was not prepared for this workload. I'm up late every night grading 
        papers and getting lesson plans together. Then I'm up early the next morning 
        meeting with parents before school. Then there are the boring, pointless 
        staff meetings, which are really "bitch sessions." I have no time for 
        myself. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">I realize I'm overwhelmed since it's my first year 
        teaching, but my mentor teacher, Joyce, who has been teaching for eleven 
        years now, says my situation may or may not change, depending on how much 
        I put into my career. She told me she hasn't read a book or written in 
        her journal in ten years! </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">I'm considering resigning at the end of the school 
        year and going back to school to find a different career. My once passionate 
        love for teaching has dwindled down to mere survival. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">If you receive this message, please give me some 
        words of encouragement so that I have a prayer of making it to Christmas. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Please tell me it gets better! </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Sincerely, </font></p>

        </b>Date:Mon, 23 Nov 1998 04:28:33-2300<br>
        </font><font color="#000000">From:allen.webb@wmich.edu<br>
        </font><font color="#000000">To:JJoh817194@aol.com <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Dear Jackie, </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Thanks so much for writing. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">I know something of what you must be going through. 
        After the second month of my first year I also decided I wasn't coming 
        back. The next August I think the only reason I signed the contract again 
        was that I was so disappointed in my performance that I wanted to prove 
        to myself that I didn't have to be a complete failure. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Not much of a reason to stick with it, was it? 
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">You talk about being overwhelmed with work. I know 
        what you mean. Five classes a day, some of them in subjects I didn't know 
        well, students with tremendous needs bombarding me every moment-some of 
        the students outright hostile-, papers to grade, almost no time to reflect 
        on what I was doing, let alone time for myself... yes, teaching middle 
        school or high school English is an awesome undertaking. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">In a way I agree with Joyce. There are teachers, 
        some of them very fine teachers, who work so hard at teaching that it 
        swallows them up entirely. It is also true that often these same people 
        can come out of balance and, in the long run, that can hurt their teaching, 
        not to mention their private lives. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">There are also teachers who are basically burned 
        out, do the minimum amount of work, and stick with poor methods just because 
        they are easier. (We both know a teacher like that; I don't need to mention 
        her name.) It is hard for me to believe that this burnout doesn't carry 
        over into their private lives as well... </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Where I disagree with Joyce is that I believe there 
        are ways to lead a balanced life, not be overwhelmed with work, and also 
        be a great teacher. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Though it is true that such a goal is hardest to 
        achieve in the first year, even in the first year you have to have some 
        kind of balance. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">You said that the word "survival" is replacing 
        your "passion for teaching." You know what? In my opinion your own survival 
        is a perfectly good goal to aim at this year. Survival is enough for the 
        first year. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">You have survived the semester so far and now just 
        take it a week, a day, even, one class period at a time and try to hold 
        on till Christmas. Don't think about whether or not you will teach again 
        next year; you can make that decision later. Don't try to be the world's 
        greatest teacher-save that for the future. For now, just survive. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">If you have a good moment in your class even just 
        once a week or with just one student that is really something to celebrate 
        and to tell other people about-no matter that the rest of the time seems 
        like chaos and disappointment. Find those good moments and give yourself 
        credit for them. You deserve it, and as you clearly recognize, you are 
        working hard to make those moments happen. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">I think it is a good sign that you can still enjoy 
        your students and that you like your colleagues. I remember when I was 
        new I found it difficult to talk with my fellow teachers about my frustrations; 
        I didn't want to give them the impression that I was doing a bad job and 
        I didn't know exactly who I should trust. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Bob Hamm, the teacher whose room was next to mine, 
        occasionally invited me out after school for a beer and a talk. I wonder 
        if he knows to this day how precious those conversations were to me. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">My poor family and friends must have been sick 
        of hearing about school and my students. It seemed like that was all I 
        could talk about-and that I couldn't stop talking. I realize now how much 
        I needed them to simply listen. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The main thing you mention in your letter is the 
        amount of work. There are no magical answers. Here are four suggestions: 
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">1) You mention staying up every night grading papers. 
        I suggest that you don't read all, or even most, of your student's writing. 
        Just as a good track coach does not have to comment every time a javelin 
        thrower practices tossing a javelin, a good teacher doesn't have to read 
        all of her student's writing. Writing takes practice and not all of that 
        practice can or should be closely scrutinized. Many assignments can just 
        be checked off. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">When you do read student writing, remember responding 
        to what they are saying is more important than correcting their errors. 
        Just a few words of human response and good listening on an occasional 
        assignment can do a great deal to encourage students to keep writing-and 
        that is the real goal, isn't it? </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">I imagine that your students have many problems 
        in their writing, right? Remember the research that shows that writing 
        lots of comments on their papers or doing whole class grammar exercises 
        is not very helpful. Mini-lessons, carefully targeted comments, and writing 
        practice are likely to be the most important-and these don't have to take 
        up a great deal of your preparation time. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Remember also that students are more likely to 
        have homework done if you collect it from them personally and individually 
        at the beginning of the period (rather than picking it up after class 
        or just having them pass papers to the front). </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">2) Steal lesson plans, worksheets, activities from 
        other teachers even if they might not be the greatest or especially relevant 
        to what you are doing. A perfectly reasonable question to ask a colleague 
        is: do you have any worksheets, assignments, or activities that you have 
        used that I could try? Experimenting in this way doesn't require much 
        preparation time either and is a good way to get ideas. It helps you develop 
        rapport with other teachers as well. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">In my first year I felt like I was going through 
        a dark tunnel. I didn't know what was coming next or how it related to 
        what came before. I didn't know where I was going and I didn't have any 
        clue about whether there was light at the end or not. Developing materials, 
        and building a really good thematically integrated curriculum at the right 
        level for your students takes years of experience; don't feel you have 
        to be there already. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">3) Allow yourself to have some classes that don't 
        require much planning on your part. Sometimes such classes are more valuable 
        than those you slave over. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">One of the best things you can do as a new teacher 
        is just have a few class periods where you and students talk with each 
        other in an open way about things that are on your mind or theirs. Issues 
        in the news, in their lives, or at school, for example. Telling stories 
        about yourself, your experiences in high school and college can be very 
        valuable to your students. Whether they admit it or not, they are looking 
        to you as a role model. These conversations may be equally or more important 
        than the official curriculum; they can also create jumping off points 
        for important writing and learning. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Reading aloud to students is a good way to spend 
        a class period. Most students enjoy being read to and they learn about 
        written language in this way. If you can find the right book, you might 
        even set up a regular schedule for reading it a chapter at a time. Short 
        stories work well. Remember having students spend time in class simply 
        reading on their own is a good utilization of the period. Writing in class 
        and writing workshops are also important and a perfectly valid way to 
        put class time to use. (Of course, as I am sure you have already found 
        out, these activities do require classroom management, students to bring 
        their materials, etc...) Nancie Atwell's book <i>In the Middle</i> is 
        a great resource for using writing workshops in middle school, and it 
        is a quick read. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">There is no shame in showing the occasional movie, 
        especially if you can integrate it into what you are doing. Many educational 
        films are not all that great, but when I was a new teacher I tried them 
        all. I don't know if your school has a computer lab or language arts software, 
        if so, experimenting with computers might be interesting. I found word 
        processing programs a great help for kids with writing difficulties. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">But don't get involved in activities or lessons 
        that will eat up your time. I learned, for example, that while I thought 
        guest speakers or field trips might take some of the pressure off, it 
        was a lot more work to have someone come to my class or try to arrange 
        a trip than to hold class as usual. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">4) Jackie, above all, take time for yourself. Keeping 
        yourself physically, mentally, and emotionally healthy is vital to maintaining 
        your poise, energy, and attentiveness as a teacher. One of the most important 
        things you can do, in my opinion, is to bring some of your own joy in 
        life to your students. It is pretty hard to do this when you are stressed 
        out, isn't it? </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The topic of your own reading and writing is one 
        point where I disagree with your colleague Joyce. I have found it very 
        important to keep reading and writing. I think it has been more valuable 
        to my students that I do this-and that I talk with them about my reading 
        and writing-than that I spend the same time grading their papers or, even 
        preparing lessons. Students will pay more attention to what you do than 
        what you say. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">I know it is hard to carve out the time, but your 
        own sanity must be your number one priority. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">I don't know if it is any comfort, but whether 
        or not you leave the profession, I suspect that the time you are in right 
        now, the last couple of months of your first semester, is likely to be 
        the absolute bottom. It was for me. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">I don't really have any magic story about myself 
        or any "silver bullets" that will make teaching easy. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">I can tell you, Jackie, that I know you well and 
        that I have tremendous faith in you. Of the many, many teachers I know, 
        I am completely confident that Jackie Johnson has exactly what it takes 
        to become, in time, one of the truly greats. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">I imagine it doesn't feel like that now. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">You might be interested in some educational research 
        that shows that it is often the most sensitive, imaginative, and intelligent 
        new teachers who have the greatest frustration and disappointment at the 
        beginning of their careers. Do you know why? </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">To me the answer is clear: it is because these 
        teachers can visualize what really good teaching ought to be like, and 
        they can also, at the same time, see very clearly how far short of this 
        goal their own teaching is falling. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Ironically, it is the potentially best teachers 
        who are often the ones to leave the profession. Should you leave, Jackie, 
        you would be in this category. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">I think this is what really killed me and made 
        me want to quit when I was at your point in teaching. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">At times it felt like it was the amount of work, 
        but, deep down, it really wasn't the overwhelming work or the stress on 
        my personal life. It was the just plain fact staring me in the face every 
        day and almost every class period: I was not a good teacher. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Hard as it was, I could survive the work (barely), 
        but what was I to make of the fact that even with my incredible efforts 
        I was not only not helping my students, I was, indeed, at times, actually 
        damaging them? </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">I had started teaching because I wanted to help 
        kids, but the truth was, and no one knew this better than me-even my colleagues 
        and friends who tried to encourage me- my classes were, very often, a 
        true disaster. The students didn't seem to want to learn. They wouldn't 
        do the work and I was lucky to even get them to sit down and listen every 
        once in a while. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">My classes were a disaster and, not only that, 
        I couldn't be myself. I was turning into just the kind of rigid, unfeeling, 
        and uptight teacher that I precisely dreaded. At times I hated myself 
        for not being able to control the class, for losing my cool, for demanding 
        too much (or not enough) from my students, for not being able to respond 
        to students as a person because I was too busy trying to figure out how 
        to take the damn attendance. I found myself trying to force students to 
        jump through the hoops of a boring, irrelevant curriculum that, to tell 
        the truth, I didn't even believe in. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">I saw that I was starting to blame the students 
        for my own failure. Yet I couldn't see any way to do it differently given 
        the situation I was in. All I could see ahead of me in this teaching career 
        that I had wanted so much was work, frustration, and a sense that I was, 
        at some profound level, a failure. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Since you know me now and have been my student, 
        I hope you agree that it didn't turn out that way. The joy and meaning 
        that teaching has brought me, in time, is something that I could barely 
        have guessed at in those dark days of the first year. I realize now that 
        eighteen years ago I was awfully young to try to confront the monumental 
        challenge of teaching. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Learning about my students, the classroom, and 
        myself that first year was like trying to drink out of a fire hydrant, 
        with the full force of the water hitting me in the face. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Now it is almost too easy for me to say that there 
        was also something wonderful about that first year, even about the way 
        I was overwhelmed and frustrated. I learned so much, including a solid 
        dose of humility. I did some wonderful and good things despite my shortcomings, 
        and, I survived to tell the story. In the years that have followed I have 
        kept learning, growing, and changing. The story is still far from over; 
        I guess in my own writing about teaching I am still trying to tell it. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Jackie, I am sorry that I have written so long 
        a letter to you. I realize you will barely have time to read it. But I 
        want you to know that you are important to me and that you are having 
        impacts on your students this year that you can't yet begin to appreciate. 
        Should you stay in teaching your influence will be beyond measure. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Yours, </font></p>

        </font><font color="#000000">To:allen.webb@wmich.edu <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">I'm so glad I was able to get in touch with you. 
        Thank you for writing back. I can't begin to thank you enough for the 
        positive messages and the suggestions. I needed to hear those things. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">I appreciate you sharing your past experiences 
        with me. I can't believe you faced some of the difficulties I am! I look 
        at you now as Allen, the awesome professor, and find it hard to picture 
        you as a struggling teacher like me. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">I guess it does take work, huh? I am too hard on 
        myself. I want to be the best NOW. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">I've tried some of your suggestions. For one, I've 
        checked homework at the beginning of class. I went around the room with 
        my gradebook and gave credit to those who did the assignment. That worked 
        well. I checked journal entries on Friday during my plan period instead 
        of taking them all home with me over the weekend. I have three plan periods, 
        so I was able to still read them thoroughly. That's one of my highlights 
        of the week...reading their daily entries. Their ways of thinking are 
        of great interest to me. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">I can't believe I didn't have any work to take 
        home with me over the weekend! I did all of my lesson plans for the upcoming 
        week during my plan periods, too, so I'm all set to go tomorrow. I set 
        time aside just for me this weekend. I went to dinner with my teacher 
        buddies and we went to one of the college basketball games last night. 
        Today we caught a movie. I even wrote in my journal this morning after 
        breakfast! I was so excited! I must have written ten pages. The last entry 
        was dated September 10th!!!! I had a lot of catching up to do! I feel 
        so much better now! </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Despite the very positive week I've had, I'm still 
        feeling uneasy. I know things won't happen overnight, but I'm still doubting 
        my decision to become a teacher. Something just doesn't feel right. I 
        can't put my finger on it, but I'm still not happy about going to work 
        in the morning. I chose a career so that I could enjoy going to work everyday...maybe 
        even look forward to it. I don't feel that with this teaching job. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">I don't want to give up on my dream just yet, but 
        I can't help but feelthat this just isn't my niche in life. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">I've been checking out graduate programs around 
        here in Greensboro. I want to keep my options open. I don't want to trap 
        myself into a profession I don't like, but at the same time, I don't want 
        to throw in the towel too soon. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Hmmm.... </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Well, thanks again for listening. I hope things 
        are going well for you. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Where are you now? How's your family? Please keep 
        in touch. Take care. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">With thanks, </font></p>
