        English teachers really want?</font> </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The English 
          teachers of Michigan want the freedom and respect to develop creative, 
          meaningful, and challenging curriculum. They want students to engage 
          in significant, extensive, and regular reading and writing.  They believe 
          this happens best under the guidance of a teacher who is passionate 
          about their curriculum and inspired by the joy and value of reading 
          and writing. Michigan English teachers are committed to fostering the 
          the skills and cultural knowledge necessary for school and work place 
          success and democratic participation in our state, country, and world.</font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">High school 
          English teachers need the Michigan Department of Education, the legislature, 
          and the governor’s office to respect their professionalism, their ability 
          to develop curriculum, and their teaching abilities. They do not want 
          the state to mandate curriculum, reading lists, or create overly specific 
          standards and curriculum expectations. They do not want to march their 
          students through narrow textbook approaches, cook book knowledge, mere 
          lists of terms to memorize, or simplistic learning strategies. They 
          want authentic, high quality, and professionally current teaching and 
          learning.</font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">High school 
          English teachers need:</font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1)  Time 
          to read their student’s papers.  Many teach way too many students, often 
          5 classes and 150 students a day.  (150 students writing 2 pages per 
          day, equals 300 pages of student writing to read per day, 1500 pages 
          of writing per week!)  They need decent working conditions.</font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2) Funds 
          to purchase the books that they passionately want to teach.  Many teachers 
          and students do not have the books they need, and there is no program 
          in the state to help teachers get books!  </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3) Programs 
          and personnel in schools that will work closely with them to help students 
          with poor preparation, low skills or special needs so that these students 
          can complete the meaningful work that their English teacher assign.  
          These students do not need workbooks of isolated knowledge or skills.</font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4) Time and 
          support to work with colleagues and other professionals.  They need 
          time to work together. They are open to continued professional learning 
          opportunities, not of the prepackaged educational-expert-knows-all type, 
          but instead led by state and national professional English teacher organizations.  
          Secondary English teachers need to be in dialogue with each other and 
          with university scholars and resource people in their communities.  
          A shinning example is the outstanding National Writing Project sites 
          in Michigan based on &quot;teachers teaching teachers&quot; model.  
          (The legislature and the governor don’t know about education in Michigan 
          and its national leadership and capacity for change if they don’t know 
          about Michigan’s writing projects sites.)  </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5) Technology 
          support that addresses serious language arts learning, not the simplistic 
          “laptop for every sixth grader” approach, but one that specifically 
          targets content driven innovators who are, in turn utilized to serve 
          as mentors to other teachers, on a teachers teaching teachers model.</font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6) On-going 
          professional education.  There is an extensive body of contextualized 
          literature on how to teach writing and reading well in English at the 
          secondary level, including books specifically on how to teach to NCTE 
          /IRA standards, and those books and resources need to become starting 
          points for teacher conversations about teaching in Michigan and around 
          the country.  I am confident when I say Michigan has the finest set 
          of university graduate programs in English education of any state in 
          America.  Teachers need support to participate in our state’s outstanding 
          graduate programs.  Legislators and the Michigan Department of Education 
          need to recognize and support those programs.</font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Simply mandating 
          new standards, even if they are high quality, does not represent a real 
          effort to improve education. Forcing grade-level-by-grade-level or course-by-course 
          curriculum written at the state level or mandated by the state legislature 
          on to teachers and students undermines meaningful learning. So does 
          marching students through standardized testing while ignoring the much 
          richer and more important assessment that happens everyday in the classroom.</font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let's utilize 
          the new language arts standards, and then move on to real educational 
          reform!</font></p>
