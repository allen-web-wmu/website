  <p>If I have sent you to this page then you can know that I would be delighted 
    to write you a recommendation letter. Though no two letters are the same, 
    all letters that I write are strongly positive. I try to look to your strengths 
    and put them forward in a way that will make it hard for a future employer 
    not to give you an interview or for a graduate or study abroad program not to accept you. 
  <p>I write letters in the order that they are requested. I usually write them on an &quot;electronic letterhead&quot; and that allows me to email them to you (you can print), an employer, an on-line recommendation system such as Interfolio. To make a request please 
    provide me with:
  <blockquote> 
    <p>1) A current copy of your resume. (This helps me remember things about 
      you and, by referring to specifics on your resume it helps me present you 
      and indicate that I know you well.)   I 
      won't usually give you advice on your resume unless you have made extensive 
      efforts to follow my <a href="http://englishjob.wikispaces.com">resume advice</a> and have 
      set an appointment to meet with me one-on-one.</p>
    <p>2) Some notes from you on what you did in my class. If you led an activity or group which group did you lead? What texts did you use? What activities 
      did you organize? If you published a website, what is the address? (Should 
      be on your resume!) If you wrote papers, what were they about? Any other 
      specific accomplishments that I should know about or be reminded of? I will 
      probably remember all of this, especially once I am reminded a bit, but 
      I want the specifics again from you so that I will get the letter right.</p>
    <p>3) Any other information or forms I need to write the letter. Often graduate schools require 
      that a specific form accompany the letter--be sure you have signed this 
      form in the appropriate place. If you want my letter to emphasize something 
      specific, let me know. It is a good idea to tell me who else is writing 
      letters for you so that my letter can compliment theirs. (If I am the only 
      English professor, for example, then I can try to be sure I speak specifically 
      to your English strengths.) If you are an aspiring teachers you may have a midterm or final evaluation of 
      intern teaching; providing me with a copy can help strengthen the letter. 
      Etc.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Writing recommendation letters is a task I take seriously. Depending on the 
    letter, it takes me between one and two hours to write each letter, sometimes 
    longer. I try to write well, get all details correct, and organize it on the page so 
    that it is attractive. It is hard to know exactly how long it will take from 
    the time you request your letter until the time I am able to write and send 
    it to you. A quick turnaround is two weeks. If there is some kind of emergency 
    need for a letter immediately, let me know. In this circumstance I can sometimes 
    jump your letter to the head of the list.
  <p>Normally, I will send the letter to you. You will have a chance to read the whole letter 
    and decide if you want to include it in your application materials. If you 
    notice mistakes, let me know and I can change and reprint the letter. If you 
    feel, based on looking at all of the letters in your file, that my letter 
    should, perhaps, change its emphasis in some way you can ask me if I would 
    be comfortable making that change. If you need a copy for your file at the 
    placement office at WMU or elsewhere, it is your responsibility then to see 
    that the original or a copy gets to the placement office--or wherever it needs 
    to be.
  <p>If I write a letter for you I expect that you will let me know what happens. 
    Did you get the job? Did you get into graduate school? Did you get the assistantship? 
    Etc. Stay in touch and let me know what you are up to--this can be useful 
    to you in future when you need another letter for whatever reason.
  <p>I wouldn't be writing for you if I didn't think you were an excellent candidate. 
    Good luck! </p>
