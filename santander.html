<I><FONT SIZE=4>The city of Santander , the community's capital,
is not only on the coast of the Bay of Biscay, but is also very
close to the Cantabrian Mountain Range, where the impressive Peaks
of Europe are to be found. The city enjoys a mild climate, and
this is so even in the summer thanks to the sea breezes. During
the summer months there is a host of leisure activities: open
air concerts, local festivities, the International Festival, bullfighting...</FONT></I>

<I><FONT SIZE=4>Santander is easily reached by sea,on the twice-weekly
ferry from Plymouth. From the French border (Hendaye) there is
a motorway coach service (around 220 kilometres), which takes
only 2.5 hours. The airport, a mere 10 minutes from the city centre,
connects Santander with Madrid and Barcelona</FONT></I>

needs in higher education, consists of some 14,000 students, a
teaching staff of 900, and approximately 450 administrative workers.
It enjoys one of the most favourable staff/student ratios within
Spain, and now ranks third out of all Spanish Universities regards
quality and standards of research according to the National Planning
and Assessment Agency.<BR>
