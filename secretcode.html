<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#000000>All teachers really want to
set high expectations and support their students' learning. All
students really want to learn, do what is asked of them, and succeed.
Unfortunately breakdowns in communication often lead to conflict
over these common interests. <BR>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=5>You are teaching your most wonderful and dearly
beloved lesson or book and students say: &quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#880000>This
is boring</FONT><FONT SIZE=5>.&quot; You almost want to strangle
them! But if you only knew &quot;This is boring&quot; might really
mean &quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#007700>I don't understand</FONT><FONT SIZE=5>,&quot;
you could see that your mission is to help them understand and
overcome their frustration.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=5>Students need to work to learn. You are creating
appropriate high expectations, yet all the students do is complain:
&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#880000>This is too much work</FONT><FONT SIZE=5>.&quot;
What they might really mean is: &quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#007700>I
am not interested in the work</FONT><FONT SIZE=5>.&quot; Students
who enjoy and are interested in what they are doing are willing
to work hard-don't assign less work, make the work more interesting.
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=5>When </FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#880000>students
misbehave</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#000000> or act out </FONT><FONT SIZE=5>it
is so easy to start to think that &quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#000000>they
just don't care</FONT><FONT SIZE=5>&quot; but it might really
mean &quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#007700>I believe I can't
do the work&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=5> or &quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#007700>I
don't understand the work</FONT><FONT SIZE=5>.&quot; or &quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#007700>I
don't know why the work is important</FONT><FONT SIZE=5>?&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=5>If the teacher tells the class: &quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#880000>I
will notice when you do not do the work and I will talk to you
about it personally</FONT><FONT SIZE=5>.&quot; Students may say:
&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#000000>What a hard ass!</FONT><FONT SIZE=5>&quot;
But they might really think be thinking: &quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#007700>The
teacher cares about me</FONT><FONT SIZE=5>.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=5>When the teacher tells the class: &quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#880000>Students
of your age (or level) really should be able to take responsibility
for turning in homework on your own</FONT><FONT SIZE=5>.&quot;
The students might think this means &quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#007700>The
teacher doesn't care if I succeed or fail.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=5>When students say: &quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#880000>I
hate writing</FONT><FONT SIZE=5>.&quot; They might really mean:
&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#007700>I am afraid I will be
criticized</FONT><FONT SIZE=5>.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=5>When students say: &quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#880000>I
hate reading</FONT><FONT SIZE=5>&quot; They might really mean:
&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#007700>I don't yet know how to
read very well</FONT><FONT SIZE=5>.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=5>When teachers believe: </FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#880000>Students
from that family or economic background can't do homework</FONT><FONT SIZE=5>.
They might be communicating to students &quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#007700>You
are not capable. We believe there is no hope for your success</FONT><FONT SIZE=5>.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=5>&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#880000>Students
are not allowed to take books home</FONT><FONT SIZE=5>.&quot;
might send the message: &quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#007700>We
are convinced our students will fail to learn, and we don't care
if they learn or not</FONT><FONT SIZE=5>.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=5>&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#880000>What
grade did I get?&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=5> might not really be
about grades, but mean instead &quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#007700>Do
you like me? Do you approve of my work?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=5>The question &quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#880000>When
will you pass our papers back?&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=5> can drive
even conscientious teachers crazy, but it might really mean &quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#007700>The
assignment I turned in meant something to me</FONT><FONT SIZE=5>.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=5>When students say &quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#880000>Did
I miss anything important when I was gone</FONT><FONT SIZE=5>?&quot;
Teacher's receive: &quot;My class means nothing to them, they
think we never do anything important.&quot; But students might
really mean: &quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#007700>I like this
class and am sorry I missed it</FONT><FONT SIZE=5>.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=5>When teachers write a lot of comments on papers
it might mean to teachers: &quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#880000>I
really care about my student's writing</FONT><FONT SIZE=5>.&quot;
But to students it could come across as: &quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#007700>The
teacher wants to tear us apart</FONT><FONT SIZE=5>.&quot; <BR>
