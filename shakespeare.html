  <p><b>Resources for Cultural Studies Teaching of Shakespeare </b> <i><br>
    <br>
    Half-Humankind Texts and Contexts in the Controversy about Women, 1540-1640</i> 
    by Katherine McManus is a collection of street pamphlets circulated during 
    Shakespeare's day that intensely debate the roles and capacities of women. 
    Placed next to any one of Shakespeare's plays these works would bring new 
    life to the discussion. <i><br>
    <br>
    Shakespeare and the Nature of Women</i> by Juliet Dusinberre explores the 
    Protestant attitude toward women and Puritan feminist sympathies in the plays. 
    <i><br>
    <br>
    Masters and Servants in English Renaissance Drama and Culture: Authority and 
    Obedience</i> by Mark Burnett is a clear and careful study of Renaissance 
    servitude that opens up new issues and perspectives for examening the relationships 
    of masters and servants in many of Shakespeare's plays. </p>
  <p><i>Masterless Men: The Vagrancy Problem in England 1560-1640</i> by A.L. 
    Beier is a fascinating look at the lives of vagrants, public attitudes toward 
    the poor, and social policies during the time of Shakespeare. Chapters or 
    sections read along with <i>Lear</i> or the <i>Henry IV</i> plays would lead 
    to interesting discussion and fresh insights. </p>
  <p><i>The Moor in English Renaissance Drama </i>by Jack D'Amico draws on the 
    historical relations of England, Morocco, and the Islamic world and provides 
    a reference point for exploring <i>The Tempest </i>and <i>The Merchant of 
    Venice</i> as well as <i>Othello</i> and ongoing attitudes toward Islamic 
    peoples. </p>
  <p>Dollimore and Sinfield's <i>Political Shakespeare: Essays in Cultural Materialism</i> 
    is an important collection of New Historicist essays on Shakespeare. It includes 
    the famous (and difficult) essay by Greenblatt &quot;Invisible Bullets&quot; 
    that connects Shakespeare's history plays with colonialism in the New World, 
    and a fine essay on Irish Colonialism and <i>The Tempest</i>, spying in <i>Measure 
    for Measure</i>, feminist criticism, homoeroticism, prostitution, etc. </p>
  <p><i>Surveillance, Militarism, and Drama in the Elizabethian Era </i>by Curt 
    Breight is somewhat difficult but strips away the myth of a benign Shakespearean 
    England and opens up possibilities for rethinking Shakespeare's treatment 
    of kinship and power. </p>
  <p><i>Shakespeare and the Jews</i> by James Shapiro and <i>Anti-Semitic Stereotypes 
    Without Jews: Images of the Jew in England 1290-1700</i> by Bernard Glassman 
    are both useful books to explore anti-Semitism in Shakespeare's day and are 
    rich resources for reading the Merchant of Venice. (The latter book also addresses 
    Chaucer's &quot;Prioress' Tale.&quot;)</p>
  <p> Stephen Greenblatt's <i>Learning to Curse: Essays in Early Modern Culture</i> 
    has wonderful chapters on<i> The Tempest, The Merchant of Venice,</i> and<i> 
    King Lear</i>. His Shakespearean Negotiations: The Circulation of Social Energy 
    in Renaissance England is somewhat more difficult but offers innovative ways 
    of thinking about the history plays. </p>
  <p><i><a href="http://ncte.1to1service.com/shoppingcart/default.asp?id_product=3346">Literature 
    and Lives</a>: A Response-based, Cultural Studies Approach to Teaching English</i> 
    by Allen Carey-Webb (NCTE 2001) addresses Shakespeare plays in the contexts 
    of homelessness, gender relations, youth violence, colonialism, and anti-semitism.</p>
