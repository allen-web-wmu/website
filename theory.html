English Teaching</FONT></FONT></SUB></B></CENTER>


<P><SUB><FONT SIZE=+1>This page examines the relationship between literary
theory, literature curriculum, and classroom practice. Clearly, theory
has played a role in the development of our thinking about curriculum and
teaching. At the same time theories have come into prominence in certain
periods as part of or a response to particular historical moments and movements.
The "contexts" listed below suggest times when approaches were in their
hey day-many theories were first conceived or developed considerably before
the time they became broadly influential.</FONT></SUB>

<P><SUB><FONT SIZE=+1>In the present there are several interesting new
theories and their effect on curriculum and teaching is still being sorted
out. These new theories and their potential for teaching are discussed
below. This page emerges out of a book project I am working on, Literature
and Lives: Response-based Cultural Studies Teaching in High School and
College. The book will combine stories of teaching experiences, my own
and others, with an introduction to literary theory for teachers.</FONT></SUB>

<CENTER><B><SUB><FONT SIZE=+2>Current Approaches and Practices</FONT></SUB></B></CENTER>


<P><B><SUB><FONT SIZE=+1>Cultural Studies</FONT></SUB></B>

<P><SUB><FONT SIZE=+1>Integrates a variety of approaches with an emphasis
on addressing social inequality. Origins in British social theory (Birmingham
School), European socialism (Frankfurt School), American popular culture,
and multicultural, postcolonial, and feminist movements.</FONT></SUB>

<P><SUB><FONT SIZE=+1>Lends itself to thematic curriculum with an issues
base, might include juxtaposing canonical literary works with marginalized
or popular culture, as a pedagogy values self-criticism, close reading,
social awareness and activism of students. Combined with Reader Response
approaches, Cultural Studies can emerge authentically from student interaction
with curriculum, rather than being "politically correct." Poststructuralisms
and New Historicism can suggest possibilities.</FONT></SUB>

<P><B><SUB><FONT SIZE=+1>Poststructuralism</FONT></SUB></B>

<P><SUB><FONT SIZE=+1>Consciousness resides in language and is socially
made, not uniquely individual or divinely given. English courses can address
the discourses from which identity (subjectivity, subject positions) arise.
No escape from the "stereotype" only richer and richer explorations of
roles and possibilities. Poststructuralism can take different forms, such
as postmodernism, deconstruction, post-marxism.</FONT></SUB>

<P><B><SUB><FONT SIZE=+1>Deconstruction</FONT></SUB></B>

<P><SUB><FONT SIZE=+1>Derrida, the founder of deconstruction, challenges
universal ideals, metaphysical certainties, or claims to unchanging truths
about the human condition. "Truths" when examined closely, when "deconstructed,"
turn out to be fictions created by language and particular systems of meaning
situated in time and place.</FONT></SUB>

<P><SUB><FONT SIZE=+1>Deconstruction invites English teachers and students
to carefully examine the most basic assumptions of the discipline. How
might terms such as "literature," "genre," "national tradition," "writer,"
"reader" even "teacher" and "student" be less precise, more blended into
their supposed "other" than they appear to be? (How is the "non-literary"
also like the "literary," the "poem" like the "short story," the "American"
like the "European" or the "African," vice versa, and so on?) How might
meaning in works of literature (or visual or institutional "texts") not
really be as clear or straight forward as it might seem at first. The English
classroom, rather than being separated from the "real world," becomes a
place where meaning and change actually take place as we examine, rethink,
and play with the texts, roles, concepts always and already set up for
us.</FONT></SUB>

<P><B><SUB><FONT SIZE=+1>Post-marxism</FONT></SUB></B>

<P><SUB><FONT SIZE=+1>Breaking with certain more rigid marxist ideas such
as the necessary determination of a social system by its economic structure,
the inevitability of revolution, or the justice of a one-party state, many
postmarxist scholars continue to draw insight and inspiration from socialist
thought while rejecting its oppressive aspects. A critique of capitalism
and materialism, a focus on class and social inequality, and a recognition
of the legitimate aspirations for "power to the people" in political, economic,
and cultural spheres are powerful ideas that emerge from marxist traditions.</FONT></SUB>

<P><SUB><FONT SIZE=+1>Drawing on these concerns teachers and students might
analyze discourses with an orientation toward exposing those that serve
the interests of dominant groups, "the hegemonic," as they seek to develop
alternative perspectives that bring forward the voice of marginal or oppressed
groups, especially the poor and working class, as the "counter hegemonic."</FONT></SUB>

<P><B><SUB><FONT SIZE=+1>Postmodernism</FONT></SUB></B>

<P><SUB><FONT SIZE=+1>Postmodernism foregrounds the concept of difference,
the jarring, collage-like existence of contemporary life The world is seen
as a cartoonesque Disneyland, an unremitting play of striking cultural
difference, the overflow of an uneven and diverse globalism where African
slum dwellers watch the Cosby show, where modern buildings are patterned
like gift wrapped Greek temples, where ancient Native American spiritual
beliefs set the pattern for cosmopolitan Latin American novels. If postmodernism
is, as one recent book is titled, a "Video Night in Katmandu" it is also
the startlingly heterogeneous student populations that teachers have in
their classrooms everyday, a member of the Crips gang, seated next to a
Cambodian refugee, seated next to an internet computer nerd, seated next
to a devoutly religious Christian fundamentalist (or all these rolled into
one person).</FONT></SUB>

<P><SUB><FONT SIZE=+1>A postmodern approach to teaching would examine the
kaleidoscopic variety of contemporary life. It would invite different voices,
it would find the historical in the contemporary, and the contemporary
in the historical. It might foreground works of magical realism (now written
not only in Latin America), explore the carnavalesque aspects of Chaucer,
Rabalais, or Swift, or the strangely altered states of science fiction.
It would juxtapose different genres, texts and materials that might not
normally be thought together but whose thinking together might illuminate
modern life. It would read its texts carefully to find the fragmentation
already built into the presumably whole and uniform. Postmodernism is thus
the most playful of the poststructuralisms, but, like the others it refuses
to accept any simple separation between the "individual" and "society."
In its best version, postmodernism teaching means respect for difference,
recognition of composite, mixture, blending, and examination of the restrictions
that prevent people from creative participation in the making and hybridizing
of culture.</FONT></SUB>

<P><B><SUB><FONT SIZE=+1>New Historicism</FONT></SUB></B>

<P><SUB><FONT SIZE=+1>New Historicism incorporates the insights from multicultural
studies, gender studies, political criticism, media studies, popular culture,
cultural studies, etc. as it looks literature of the past. New Historicists
distrust expressions like "in the eyes of the later middle ages" and tend
to see historical periods not as consistent or coherent, but as made up
of different social groups in contest with one another. Literature should
not be thought of as transcending the time it was written, but instead,
as deeply involved in it, reflecting the period's tensions and diversity.
Stephen Greenblatt says that New Historicists have "been less concerned
to establish the organic unity of literary works and more open to such
works as fields of force, places of dissension and shifting interests,
occasions for the jostling of orthodox and subversive impulses." New Historicists
also try to be conscious of how our position in the present shapes our
view of the past and of ways that the understanding of literature and history
changes over time.</FONT></SUB>

<P><SUB><FONT SIZE=+1>A New Historicist approach creates the possibility
of making the study of traditional literature more contentious, controversial,
and considerably more interesting and relevant to students. For example,
a teacher approaching Shakespeare from a New Historicist perspective might
ask students to compare his portrayal of women with street pamphlets from
his day vociferously arguing about women's rights. Or, she might have students
explore the Elizabethan treatment of peasant revolts and public forms of
torture of disloyal subjects against Shakespeare's presentation of treason
and regicide. Or, she might have students compare English or Spanish writing
about Native Americans to Shakespeare's portrayal of Caliban in "The Tempest."
Or, she might have students analyze contemporary sermons about Jews along
with Shakespeare's presentation of Shylock, in "Merchant of Venice." All
of the primary historical materials I am mentioning here are readable,
relatively brief, and available. Yet, the textbooks and literature anthologies
currently available effectively isolate Shakespeare, for example, from
the tensions and controversies of his age and our own, instead contextualizing
student reading of the plays with simple bucolic descriptions of Stratford-on-Avon
or diagrams of the Globe theater. This sanitized "safe" history actually
makes it harder for students to see what is really interesting about Shakespeare's
time (or that of any of writer's) and why it might be relevant to us.</FONT></SUB>
