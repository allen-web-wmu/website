  <p>It is with sorrow that we announce the passing of Tom Webb, well known in the art and environmental community in Portland and Newport. Born in Minneapolis, Tom relocated to Portland with his family in 1972. He enjoyed his new neighborhood and made many friends at Ainsworth Elementary School. As a kid he loved sports, especially basketball. He spent hours shooting baskets on the street and at the MAC club. He was on the Lincoln High School golf team, played bridge, and was a lifelong Trailblazers fan. 
  <p>Tom graduated from Lincoln High School in 1983 and attended Vassar College where he earned a bachelor’s degree in Economics and also studied art and English. After graduation he pursued a variety of endeavors driven by his genuine interest in politics, the environment, creative arts, and the community. In 1988 Tom was a Field Organizer for the Dukakis campaign in Oregon and several other states. Four years later he went to the Democratic National Convention as a delegate for Jerry Brown. He worked at 1000 friends of Oregon, taught a course in magazine development at the Pacific Northwest College of Art, and worked as the primary print and online editor for the School of Extended Studies at Portland State University. In 2006 he landed a part-time assignment writing a Portland Trailblazer blog and weekly column for the St. Johns Sentinel. This gave him press credentials to attend Blazer games, interview players and sit with other sports writers covering the games. Tom was on the board of Earth Share, was the Outreach Director for Honoring our Rivers and founded the Doug Fir Fiction Award, as well as Word on the Street, Oregon’s largest one-day celebration of the written word.
   
    <p>In the midst of all these pursuits, Tom was especially dedicated to the Orlo Foundation and in 1993 cofounded Bear Deluxe Magazine and for over 20 years he was the Editor-in-Chief  exploring environmental issues through the creative arts. From 2001 to 2014 he was the Executive Director of the Orlo Foundation, writing grants and fundraising over $2.5 million. His genuine interest and concern unleashed his fun, clever and sometimes offbeat ideas.  In 2001, Tom cofounded the Orlo Video Slams – based on poetry slams, the video slams enabled emerging filmmakers the opportunity to screen their work and compete for cash prizes.</p>
    <p>Tom also dedicated himself passionately to his work as the director of the Newport Visual Arts Center from 2014 to 2022.  In this role, he curated, presented, and promoted over 180 exhibitions of regional and local artists, enhanced educational programing especially for youth. He wrote successful grants, oversaw capital improvement, facilitated partnerships with municipal and nonprofit organizations, supervised staff and over 100 volunteers and interns.  He led the implementation of the ceramics studio, and dreamed up the Oregon Coast Arts Bus, a beautiful mobile arts classroom serving coastal communities.  Under his guidance, the center became a hub for creativity, fostering a sense of community among artists and art enthusiasts.</p>
    <p>Tom was easy going, creative, had a wry humor and was an excellent writer and storyteller.  Non-judgmental and kind, he was fun to be around.  Tom lost both of his parents at a young age, but always made sure to remember his mother’s birthday, and to keep the family heritage alive.  A kindhearted and sentimental person, universally loved by all who knew him, Tom leaves a large and loving community of friends. A caring uncle who related with children, he was adored by his nieces and nephews. He had a knack for giving unexpected but favored Christmas gifts wrapped in newspaper. </p>

  <p>A proud Oregonian, active in both Portland and Newport communities, he had recently moved back to Newport after a short time in Eugene, when he passed away on December 9th from a sudden heart attack.  His passing comes as an unexpected shock to family and friends, who will always remember the sparkle in his eyes and his upturned playful smile.  </p>
  <p>Tom is survived by his siblings Allen, George and Janet, as well as nieces and nephews Nate, Jessica, Cameron, Lucia, Ari, and Lexi.  A memorial and celebration of life will be held at 1:30 PM on Sunday January 14th at <a href="https://www.castawayportland.com">Castaway Portland</a> at 1900 NW 18th Ave. </p>
  <p>Memorial gifts dedicated in Tom’s name can be given to support the Bear Deluxe Magazine at <a href="https://orlo.org/support/">Bear Deluxe Magazine</a> </p>
