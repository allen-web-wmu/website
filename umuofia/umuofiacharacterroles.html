    of the tribe and traditional healing methods.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ogbuefi_Ezendu<br>
    You are one of the oldest and wisest members of the tribe. You are always 
    open to discussion, even with people with whom you do not agree. You were 
    once a great warrior, but now value peace and the lives of tribal members 
    above all.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ogbuefi_Ugouna<br>

    important role in the religion of the tribe.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Osu<br>
    You and your family are considered &#8220;untouchable&#8221; and must always 
    do the dirtiest and hardest work in the village. You have accepted this position, 
    but... </font></p>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You are a zealous convert to Christianity

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Africans from other Villages:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ozoemena<br>
    You are a female survivor of the village of Abame. After a white man on a 
    bicycle was killed, the British army came to your village on Eke market day, 
    surrounded it and began to fire their terrible repeating guns into the crowd. 
    You have come to warn Umuofia and Mbanta of the dangers of the British.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mr. Kiaga<br>
    You are Ibo from Umuru, a village near the sea, and an early convert to Christianity. 
    You have come to the village of Mbanta to bring others to your faith.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">kunna<br>
    You are a great man from another village who talks extensively with Mr._Brown 
    about religion.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kotma and Ashy-Buttocks<br>
    You are court messangers from Umuru, a tribe near the coast that speaks a 
    somewhat different dialect from the people of Umuofia. Your village was one 
    of the first colonized by the British and you have worked hard to learn to 
    speak and write English. You realize that from now forward the British will 
    have supreme military and political power in the country. You work for the 
    District Commissioner and will do what is necessary to keep your position.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">British </font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mr._Brown<br>
    You are a liberal Christian Missionary and have dedicated your life to bringing 
    Africans to Christianity. You respect them as people and you hope to help 
    them understand by reasonable argument and education that their beliefs are 
    superstitious.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mr._Green<br>
    You are a fundamentalist missionary and have dedicated your life to saving 
    heathens from eternal damnation. You consider their beliefs to be ignorant 
    and unbiblical, and you wonder whether anyone who has once had such beliefs 
    can ever be trusted, especially in positions of church leadership.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">District Commissioner<br>
    You are an officer of the British Army who has been given authority over the 
    Lower Niger region. You hope is to pacify African resistance to the British. 
    You support the work of missionaries converting these primitive people. You 
    have court messengers who work for you, and, if needed, you can request support 
    from the British army occupying the country. </font></p>
