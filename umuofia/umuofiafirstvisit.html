<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In your first visit to Umuofia think 
  of yourself as a thoughtful and open-minded tourist. You want to learn the layout 
  of the village and closely examine the people and objects you find there. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Enter into the Village of Umuofia 
  from the WMU <a href="http://www.wmich.edu/teachenglish/encore">Secondary Worlds</a> 
  website. To simply visit Umuofia you can enter at a &quot;Guest.&quot; Proceed 
  first to the <em>Things Fall Apart</em> Room from which you can enter into the 
  &quot;Village Square.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You will want to visit every &quot;room&quot; 
  in the village. For this it may be helpful to study the <a href="umuofiamap.html">Village 
  of Umuofia Map</a>. You will also want to look at all of the objects and images 
  in each &quot;room.&quot; Learn how to use the &quot;say&quot; command.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Choose three images of people, places, 
  or objects that interest you, carefully study them, and write at least a paragraph 
  about each one. Your paragraph can address these questions: </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What do you notice in the image? 
    What questions do you have about what you see? What might be the &quot;back 
    story&quot; to this image? How does the image compare with what you might 
    have imagined from reading <em>Things Fall Apart</em>? </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you enter the Village of Umuofia 
  at the same time as other students you can share your comments with them using 
  the &quot;say&quot; command.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some of the &quot;rooms&quot; or 
  objects play traditional West African Music by <a href="http://www.mp3tunes.com/artist_details.php?artist_id=17327">Yaya 
  Diallo</a>. </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What role does this music play 
    in the novel, <em>Things Fall Apart</em>? What can you learn from the internet 
    about traditional African music? Do you like this kind of music? How has it 
    influenced music around the world?</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For your information, the images 
  in the Village of Umuofia are authentic black and white photos used witih permission 
  from the <a href="http://mccoy.lib.siu.edu/jmccall/jones/">Jones Photographic 
  Archive of Southeastern Nigerian Art and Culture</a>. You are invited to further 
  explore the images in this free public archive. Some questions to guide your 
  consideration: </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Who took these photographs? Why 
    were they taken? Are they consistent culturally and historically with the 
    descriptions found in <em>Things Fall Apart</em>? What might the villagers 
    have thought about the photographer and having their pictures taken? In what 
    sense are the photographs &quot;posed&quot;?</font></li>
