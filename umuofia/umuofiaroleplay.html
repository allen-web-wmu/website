<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now that you have read <em>Things 
  Fall Apart</em> and made a first visit to the Village of Umuofia, you are ready 
  to take on a character and engage in the role play activity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You teacher will assign you to a 
  character from the list of <a href="umuofiacharacterroles.html">character roles</a>. 
  Every character is important to the role play activity. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Begin by writing answers to these 
  questions about your character. </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What is important to your character? 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Which of the other characters does 
    your character most closely relate to? What are these relationships like? 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In what part of the village does 
    your character spend most of his or her time? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How does your character view the 
    changes taking place in the village? Why?</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the time set for the role play 
  enter into the Village of Umuofia from the WMU <a href="http://www.wmich.edu/teachenglish/encore">Secondary 
  Worlds</a> website. Login using the username and password assigned to your character. 
  Your character &quot;speaks&quot; when you click on &quot;say,&quot; type in 
  text, and hit the &quot;return&quot; key.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Based on the character user name 
  and password your teacher assigns you, you will &quot;wake up&quot; in a particular 
  room as other characters are waking up in the same room. You might begin by 
  spending some time in this room talking with these characters about what the 
  changes taking place in Umuofia and what, if anything, should be done about 
  them. Then, move on to other rooms and conversations with other characters.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What will characters say and do in 
  your Village of Umuofia?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Immediately after the role play is 
  finished, write about what you learned from the activity.</font></p>
