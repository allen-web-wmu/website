<hr>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Village of Umuofia brings students 
  into the imaginative environment of <em>Things Fall Apart</em>, what <a href="http://www.boisestate.edu/english/jwilhelm/index.htm">Jeff 
  Wilhelm</a> called reading's &quot;secondary world.&quot; Student success in 
  this virtual reality will depend greatly on you, the teacher. The environment 
  can be used in different ways; what I suggest below is only one approach. As 
  well as serving as a class role play, it can be explored by individual students 
  or groups. The role play can be organized for a single class, or, with careful 
  planning, can involve multiple classes at the same time from different places, 
  including different countries. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Before they participate in the role 
  play, students should spend time exploring the Village of Umuofia, its rooms 
  and objects, and learn the easy actions that will let them move from room to 
  room and speak. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have created a <a href="umuofiamap.html">map</a> 
  and an activity that will facilitate this learning called <a href="umuofiafirstvisit.html">First 
  Visit.</a> First Visit can take place before, during, or after reading the novel. 
  As I constructed the activity it can be assigned as homework requiring approximately 
  one hour, and need not be done simultaneously by all students at the same time. 
  On the other hand, it would also be effective to do First Visit as an in-class 
  activity perhaps using a data projector where everyone can see the environment 
  as the teacher navigates through it. Teacher-led discussion of the images before 
  students write about them scaffolds their learning.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since the world of the Igbo in the 
  19th Century is so different from that of students today, the photographs used 
  in this website and in the Village of Umuofia will be useful to help students 
  understanding of the novel. The students are encouraged to explore the archive 
  from which the photos are taken and ask critical questions about the origin 
  of these pictures after the <a href="umuofiafirstvisit.html">First Visit</a> 
  activity. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Students may be very interested in 
  the traditional West African music they will hear in the Village of Umuofia. 
  An attentive reading of T<em>hings Fall Apart</em> will show the close integration 
  of music, story telling, dance, and ritual celebration in the lives of the Igbo. 
  Traditional West African music has had an enormous impact on world music and 
  students may enjoy learning more about this important aspect of African cultures.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <a href="umuofiaroleplay.html">Role 
  Play </a>activity will work best if students have had a chance to think -- and 
  write -- from the point of view of their character before engaging in it. Contact 
  me via email, <a href="mailto:allenwebb@wmich.edu">allen.webb@wmich.edu</a>, 
  and I can provide you with usernames and passwords that will allow your students 
  to &quot;wake up&quot; in the Village of Umuofia in character. Though there 
  are 39 <a href="umuofiacharacterroles.html">character roles</a> listed, this 
  number is flexible. The environment can work well with fewer, or with more characters 
  -- many roles can be doubled, that is played by two students at the same time 
  working at the same terminal. (You will want to verify that the time you plan 
  to use the environment it is not in use by another teacher, the first class 
  that enters with the passwords will have priority. It may be possible to coordinate 
  your use of the space with students from another school.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a way the virtual reality functions 
  like a related group of chat rooms: all students must be present at the same 
  time for them to communicate with each other. Although the role play is designed 
  to be used in a single class period, it can also be extended to several class 
  periods, or longer, depending on the goals of the teacher and the interest of 
  students. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Students need to engage in a careful 
  reading and discussion of Achebe's novel for this activity to be useful to them. 
  There are many sites on the internet to support the reading of <em>Things Fall 
  Apart</em>, including <a href="http://www.wsu.edu:8080/%7Ebrians/anglophone/achebe.html">Paul 
  Brians' Study Guide</a> and <a href="http://web.cocc.edu/cagatucci/classes/hum211/achebtfa.htm">Cora 
  Agatucci's Reading and Study Questions</a>. I have developed a page to help 
  students write critical <a href="http://homepages.wmich.edu/%7Eacareywe/314thingsfallapartessay.html">analysis 
  papers </a>about the novel.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Drawing on the novel I have identified 
  a series of <a href="umuofiaevents.html">events</a> that can happen in the Village. 
  You can use these events to stimulate dialogue and role play. You might prepare 
  the students for the events by prior writing or discussion or simply announce 
  as students are engaged in the role play. Experience of teachers using the environment 
  shows the advantage of carefully organizing student activity in the Village 
  of Umuofia.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Village of Umuofia will be a 
  far richer experience if students write and discuss about what they are learning 
  during or soon after participating. Questions they might consider include:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> How was our experience similar 
    to and how different from the novel?<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why did certain characters act 
    the way they did during our experience in the Village of Umuofia?<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How has my experience in the Village 
    of Umuofia virtual reality changed or enhanced my understanding of the novel 
    and the historical events on which it is based?</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am currently engaged in research 
  on the use of virtual reality environments to supplement the teaching of literature 
  and I welcome your questions, feedback, comments, and participation in this 
  research effort.</font></p>
