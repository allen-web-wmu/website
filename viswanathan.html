            <p>from: &quot;Currying Favor: The Politics of British Educational and Cultural Policy in India, 1813-1854&quot; by Gauri Viswanathan.  <em>Social Text,</em> No. 19/20 (Autumn, 1988), pp. 85-104.</p>
            <p>Antonio Gramsci illuminates the relations of culture and  power through the  useful insight that cultural domination works by consent and often  precedes  conquest by force. Power, operating concurrently at two clearly distinguishable  levels, produces a situation where &quot;the supremacy of a social group manifests  itself in two ways, as 'domination' and as 'intellectual and moral  leadership.' . ..  It seems clear . .. that there can, and indeed must be hegemonic activity even  before the rise to power, and that one should not count only on the material  force which power gives in order to exercise an effective  leadership.&quot;...</p>

          <p align="left">Arguably, detailed records of self-incrimination are not routinely preserved  in state archives. But where such records do exist, the evidence is often  compelling enough to suggest that the Gramscian notion is not merely a  theoretical construct but an uncannily accurate  description of historical process,  howsoever subject it may be to the  vagaries of particular circumstances. A case  in point is British India, whose checkered history of cultural confrontation  conferred a sense of urgency to  voluntary cultural assimilation as the most  effective form of  political action. The political choices are spelled out in the most chilling terms: &quot;The Natives must either be kept down by a sense of our  power, or they must willingly submit from a conviction that we are more wise,  more just, more humane, and more anxious to improve their condition than any  other rulers they could possibly have.&quot;
        <p align="left">Implicit in this statement by a high-ranking British official in the Bombay  administration is a recognition of the importance of self-representation, or the  production of an image of the &quot;ideal&quot; Englishman. Logically, there were two  sources from which the colonial subjects could derive an idea of the humaneness  and justness of their rulers, one actual (that is, through British actions and  behavior) and the other representational. Of the two, the former posed more  serious problems of control and consistency. The East India Company servants  who were sent to India were often charged by Englishmen themselves with  intemperance and rapacity. Their actions in India belied the fondest hope that  colonial subjects would be convinced of the superiority of English ideals. Since  the actual image could not supply the appropriate model, representational sources  increasingly came to be relied on to do the work. This essay deals with the ways  in which the literature and arts of England were gradually put to use to convey  an image of the &quot;ideal&quot; Englishman. ...
        <p align="left">One cannot fail to be struck by the peculiar irony of a history in which  England's initial involvement with the education of the natives derived not from  a conviction of native immorality as the later discourse might lead one to believe,  but from the depravity of their own administrators and merchants.One cannot fail to be struck by the peculiar irony of a history in which  England's initial involvement with the education of the natives derived not from  a conviction of native immorality as the later discourse might lead one to believe,  but from the depravity of their own administrators and merchants.One cannot fail to be struck by the peculiar irony of a history in which  England's initial involvement with the education of the natives derived not from  a conviction of native immorality as the later discourse might lead one to believe,  but from the depravity of their own administrators and merchants.        
        <p align="left">This mission to revitalize Indian culture and learning and protect it from  the oblivion to which foreign rule might doom it merged with the then current  literary vogue of &quot;Orientalism&quot; and formed the mainstay of that phase of British  rule in India known as the &quot;Orientalist&quot; phase. Orientalism was adopted as an  official policy partly out of expediency and caution and partly out of an emergent  political sense that an efficient Indian administration rested on an understanding  of Indian culture. It grew out of the concern of Warren Hastings, governor-  general from 1774 to 1785, that British administrators and merchants in India  were not sufficiently responsive to Indian languages and Indian traditions. The  distance between ruler and ruled was perceived to be so vast as to evoke the  sentiment that &quot;we rule over them and traffic with them, but they do not  understand our character, and we do not penetrate theirs. The consequence is  that we have no hold on their sympathies, no seat in their affections.&quot; Hastings'  own administration was distinguished by a tolerance for the native customs and  by a cultural empathy unusual for its time. Underlying Orientalism was a tacit  policy of reverse acculturation, whose goal was to train British administrators  and civil servants to fit into the culture of the ruled and to assimilate them  thoroughly into the native way of life.        
        <p align="left">Opposing Orientalism was the countermovement of Anglicism, which  gained ascendancy in the 1830s. Briefly, Anglicism grew as an expression of  discontent with the policy of promoting the Oriental languages and literatures  in native education. In its vigorous advocacy of Western instead of Eastern  learning, it came into sharp conflict with the proponents of Orientalism, who  vehemently insisted that such a move would have disastrous consequences, the  most serious being the alienation of Indians from British rule. ...        
        <p align="left">Although chaplains [Clapham Evangelicals] had hitherto been appointed by the East India Company  to serve the needs of the European population  residing in India, the English  Parliament had consistently refused to modify the  Company charter to allow  missionary work in India. The main reason for government resistance was an  apprehension that the Indians would feel threatened and eventually cause trouble  for England's commercial ventures. Insurrections around the country were  invariably blamed on proselytizing activity in the area. The fear of further acts  of hostility on religious grounds grew so great that it  prompted a temporary suspension of the Christianizing mission. In keeping with the government policy  of religious neutrality, the Bible was proscribed and scriptural teaching forbid-  den.  The opening of India to missionaries, along with the commitment of the  British to native improvement, might appear to suggest a victory for the  missionaries, encouraging them perhaps to anticipate official support for their  Evangelizing mission. But if they had such hopes, they were to be dismayed by  the continuing checks on their activities, which grew impossibly stringent.  Publicly, the English Parliament demanded a guarantee that large-scale prosely-  tizing would not be carried out in India. Privately, though, it needed little  persuasion about the distinct advantages that would flow from missionary contact  with the Indians and their &quot;many immoral and disgusting habits.&quot;          
        <p align="left">Though representing a convergence of interests, these two events-of  British involvement in Indian education and the entry of missionaries-were far  from being complementary or mutually supportive. On the contrary, they were  entirely opposed to each other both in principle and in fact. The inherent  constraints operating on British educational policy are apparent in the central  contradiction of a government committed to the improvement of the people  while being restrained from imparting any direct instruction in the religious  principles of the English nation. The encouragement of Oriental learning, seen  initially as a way of fulfilling the ruler's obligations to the subjects, seemed to  accentuate rather than diminish the contradiction. For as the British swiftly  learned to their dismay, it was impossible to promote Orientalism without  exposing the Hindus and Muslims to the religious and moral tenets of their  respective faiths-a situation that was clearly not tenable with the stated goal of  &quot;moral and intellectual improvement.&quot;          
        <p align="left">This tension between increasing involvement in Indian education and  enforced noninterference in religion was productively resolved through the  introduction of English literature. Significantly, the direction to this solution  was present in the Charter Act itself, which ambiguously stated that &quot;a sum of  not less than one lac of rupees shall be annually applied to the revival and  improvement of literature, and the encouragement of the learned natives of  India.&quot;7 While the use of the word &quot;revival&quot; may weight the interpretation on the  side of Oriental literature, the almost deliberate imprecision suggests a more  fluid government position in conflict with the official espousal of Orientalism.  Over twenty years later Macaulay was to seize on this very ambiguity to argue  that the phrase clearly meant Western literature, and denounced in on uncertain  terms attempts to interpret the clause as a reference to Oriental literature:

            <p>It is argued, or rather  taken for granted, that by literature,  the Parliament  can  have meant only Arabic and Sanskrit literature,  that they never would have given the honourable appellation of a learned native to a native who was  familiar  with the poetry of Milton, the  Metaphysics  of Locke, the Physics of  Newton; but that they meant to designate by that name only such persons as  might have studied in the sacred books of the Hindoos all the uses of  cusa-grass,  and all the mysteries  of absorption  into the Deity.</p>

          <p align="left">Macaulay's plea on behalf of English literature had a major influence on the  passing of the English Education Act in 1835, which officially required the  natives of India to submit to its study. But  English was not an unknown entity  in India at that time, for rudimentary instruction in the  language had been  introduced more than two decades earlier.  Initially, English did not supersede  Oriental studies but was  taught alongside it. Yet it was clear that it enjoyed a  different status, for there was a  scrupulous attempt to establish separate colleges  for its study. Even when it was  taught within the same college, the English  course of studies was  kept separate from the course of Oriental study, and was  attended by a different set of students. The rationale was that if the  English  department drew students who were attached only to its department and to no  other (that is, the Persian or the Arabic or the  Sanskrit), the language might  then be taught &quot;classically&quot; in much the same way that Latin and Greek were  taught in England.            
          <p align="left">Though based on literary material, the early British Indian curriculum in  English was primarily devoted to language studies. However, by the 1820s the  atmosphere of secularism in which these studies were conducted became a major  case for concern to the missionaries who were  permitted to enter India after  1813. One missionary in India, the Rev. William Keane,  argued that while  European education had done much to destroy &quot;heathen&quot; superstition, it had not  substituted any moral  principle in its place. The exclusion of the Bible had a  demoralizing effect, he claimed, for it tended to produce evils in the country and  to give the native mind

          <p align="left">The missionaries  got further support from an unexpected quarter. The  military officers who testified in the parliamentary sessions on Indian education  joined hands with them in arguing that a secular education in English would  increase the natives'  capacity for evil because it would elevate their intellects without providing the moral principles to keep them in check. Major-General  Rowlandson of the British Army warned, &quot;I have seen native students who had  obtained an insight into European literature and history, in whose minds there  seemed to be engendered a spirit of disaffection towards the British Govern-  ment.&quot;10 While obviously the missionaries and the military had different interests  at stake, with the latter perhaps not quite as interested in the souls of the heathen  as the former, they were both clearly aiming at the same goal: the prevention of  situations leading to political disunity or lawlessness. The alliance between the  two undoubtedly proved fruitful insofar as it loosened the British resistance to  the idea of religious instruction for the natives and made them more conscious  of the need to find alternate modes of social control.            
          <p align="left">In English social history the function of providing authority for individual  action and belief and of dispensing moral laws for the formation of character had  traditionally been carried out through the medium of church-controlled educa-  tional institutions. The aristocracy maintained a monopoly over access to  church-dominated education and instituted a classical course of studies that it  shared with the clergy, but from which the middle and working classes were  systematically excluded. The classical curriculum under church patronage in  England became identified as a prerequisite for social leadership and, more  subtly, as the means by which social privilege was protected. This alliance  between church and culture consecrated the concept of station in life and directly  supported the existing system of social stratification: while the classical curricu-  lum served to confirm the upper orders in their superior social status, religious  instruction was given to the lower orders to fit them for the various duties of  life and to secure them in their appropriate station. The alliance between church  and culture was thus equally an alliance between ideas of formative education  and of social control.            
          <p align="left">As late as the 1860s, the &quot;literary curriculum&quot; in British educational  establishments remained polarized around classical studies for the upper classes  and religious studies for the lower. As for what is now known as the subject of  English literature, the British educational system had no firm place for it until  the last quarter of the nineteenth century, when the challenge posed by the  middle classes resulted in the creation of alternative institutions devoted to  &quot;modern&quot; studies.            
          <p align="left">It is quite conceivable that educational development in British India may  have run the same course as it did in England, were it not for one crucial  difference: the strict controls on Christianizing activities. Clearly, the texts that  were standard fare for the lower classes in England could not legitimately be  incorporated into the Indian curriculum without inviting violent reactions from  the native population, particularly the learned classes. And yet the fear lingered in the British mind that without submission of the individual to moral law or  the authority of God, the control they were able to secure over the lower classes  in their own country would elude them in India. Comparisons were on occasion  made between the situation at home and in India, between the &quot;rescue&quot; of the  lower classes in England, &quot;those  living in the dark recesses of our great cities at  home, from the state of degradation consequent on their vicious and depraved  habits, the offspring of ignorance and sensual indulgence,&quot; and the elevation of  the Hindus and Muslims whose &quot;ignorance and degradation&quot; required a remedy  not adequately supplied by their respective faiths.1l Such comparisons served to  intensify the search for other social institutions to take over from religious  instruction the function of communicating the laws of the social order.            
          <p align="left">Provoked by missionaries on the one hand and fears of native insubordina-  tion on the other, British administrators discovered an ally in English literature  to support them in maintaining control of the natives under the guise of a liberal  education. With both secularism and religion appearing as political liabilities,  literature appeared to represent a perfect synthesis of these two opposing  positions. ...          
          <p align="left">The first stage in the process was an assertion of structural congruence  between Christianity and English literature. Missionaries had long argued on  behalf of the shared history of religion and literature, of a tradition of belief and  doctrine creating a common culture of values, attitudes, and norms. They had  ably cleared the way for the realization that as the &quot;grand repository of the book  of God&quot; England had produced a literature that was immediately marked off  from all non-European literatures, being &quot;animated, vivified, hallowed, and  baptized&quot; by a religion to which Western man owed his material and moral  progress. The difference was rendered as a contrast between

          <p align="left">If not in quite the same eloquent terms, some missionaries tried to point  out to the government that though they pretended to say they taught no  Christianity, they actually taught a great deal, for it was virtually impossible to  take Christianity out of an English education, and much more of scriptural  teaching was imparted than was generally admitted. The Rev. W. Keane tried  to persuade officials that

So with Goldsmith,  Abercrombie  on the Mental Powers, and many others books which are taught  in the schools; though the natives hear they are not to be proselytized,  yet  such books have undoubtedly sometimes a favourable effect in actually  bringing them to us missionaries.13

          <p align="left">The missionary description was appropriated in its entirety by government  officers. But while the missionaries made such claims in order to force the  government to sponsor teaching of the Bible, the administrators used the same  argument to prove English literature made such direct instruction redundant.  Several steps were initiated to incorporate selected English literary texts into the  Indian curriculum on the claim that these works were supported in their morality  by a body of evidence that also upheld the Christian faith. In their official  capacity as members of the Council on Education, Macaulay and his brother-in-  law Charles Trevelyan were among those engaged in a minute analysis of English  texts to prove what they called the &quot;diffusive benevolence of Christianity&quot; in them.  The process of curricular selection was marked by weighty pronouncements on  the &quot;sound Protestant Bible principles&quot; in Shakespeare, the &quot;strain of serious piety&quot;  in Addison's Spectator papers, the &quot;scriptural morality&quot; of Bacon and Locke, the  &quot;devout sentiment&quot; of Abercrombie, the &quot;noble Christian sentiments&quot; in Adam  Smith's Moral Sentiments (which was hailed as the &quot;best authority for the true  science of morals which English literature could supply&quot;).14 The cataloguing of  shared features had the effect of convincing detractors that the government could  effectively cause voluntary reading of the Bible and at the same time disclaim any  intentions of proselytizing. ...          
          <p align="left">The characterization of English literature as  intellectual production suggested a different process of reading, requiring the  exercise of reason rather than unquestioning faith. The history of the &quot;despotic  Orient&quot; was adequate proof from the British viewpoint that a literature claiming  to provide divine revelation diluted the capacity of the individual mind to resist  the manipulations of a priestly caste. By the terms of this argument, not only did  Oriental literature lull into the individual into a passive acceptance of the  fabulous incidents as actual occurrences; more alarmingly, the acceptance of  mythological events as factual description stymied the mind's capacity to  extrapolate a range of meanings for analysis and verification in the real world.  The logic of associating reason with an approach to literary texts as types of  human activity was a simple one: The products of human consciousness must  submit to interpretation because their creating subject is man not God, man in  all his imperfection and fallibility. Because interpretation by definition entails a  plurality of response, the receiving mind is pressured all the more to weight the  truth-value of each possibility, thereby activating rational processes of discrimina-  tion and judgment-intellectual skills unanimously held to be utterly alien to a  literature conceived as divine agency.           
          <p align="left">Two, as an example of human invention drawing its material from a  rationally perceived world, English literature disciplined the mind to think and  reason from the force of evidence. The Cartesian influence is especially strong  in this description, particularly in the argument that the element of doubt  attending upon the senses sets the mind in a state of intellectual ferment, forcing  it to do battle with error until a full knowledge of the truth is reached. Since an  individually realized truth would have proceeded through the stages of rational  investigation-of detached observation, analysis, verification, and application-  its claims to universal, objective knowledge were unquestionably greater, it was  concluded, than the claims to truth of received tradition. ...          
          <p align="left">In effect, the strategy of locating authority in English texts all but effaced  the often sordid history of colonialist expropriation, material exploitation, and  class and race oppression behind European world dominance. Making the  Englishman known to the natives through the products of his mental labor  removed him from the plane of ongoing colonialist activity-of commercial  operations, military expansion, administration of territories-and de-actualized  and diffused his material presence in the process. In a crude, parodic reworking  of the Cartesian formula, production of thought defined the Englishman's true  essence, overriding all other aspects of his identity-his personality, actions,  behavior. His material reality as subjugator and alien ruler was dissolved in his  mental output; the blurring of the man and his works effectively removed him  from history. The English literary text functioned as a surrogate Englishman in  his highest and most perfect state, and to quote again from Trevelyan, &quot;[The  Indians] daily converse with the best and wisest Englishmen through the medium  of their works, and form ideas, perhaps higher ideas of our nation than if their  intercourse with it were of a more personal kind.&quot; The  split between the  material and the cultural practices of colonialism is nowhere sharper than in the  progressive rarefaction of the rapacious, exploitative, and ruthless actor of history  into the reflective subject of literature.
