<p>Webquests are an exciting way to bring the resources of the internet into classroom 
  teaching and they are ideal for reader response activities and cultural studies 
  projects. There are many sites on the internet that support webquests -- and 
  many &quot;webquests&quot; that are actually something less, mere &quot;hot 
  lists,&quot; or &quot;treasure hunts,&quot; or &quot;scrapbooks.&quot; (The 
  <a href="http://www.kn.pacbell.com/wired/fil">Filamentality</a> &quot;Activity 
  Formats&quot; page defines these terms pretty well.)</p>
<p>Perhaps the best resource for webquests is the page created by Bernie Dodge 
  at San Diego State University. Study carefully <a href="http://edweb.sdsu.edu/webquest/webquest.html">The 
  Webquest Page</a>. Begin by reading carefully through at least four or five 
  <a href="http://edweb.sdsu.edu/webquest/matrix.html">examples</a> --there are 
  many for middle school and high school language arts. Look at quests at different 
  levels. Some quests are clearly better than others. I like those that involve 
  collaboration, have a clearly defined and creative final project, (Look for, 
  instance, at the <a href="http://coe.west.asu.edu/students/madams/webquest.htm">Odyssey 
  Theme Park</a>) and that involve a close and careful understanding of the text 
  (Look at the <a href="http://www.msu.edu/user/rozemaro/quest/home.htm">Heart 
  of Darkness Webquest</a> ). </p>
<p>Webquests are a great way to create a cultural studies project around a work 
  of literature. There are not very many webquests that take the ideas of cultural 
  studies and apply them to literature--create one that will become a model to 
  others. </p>
<p> As you prepare to build your own web quest, examine Bernie Dodge's <a href="http://edweb.sdsu.edu/webquest/materials.htm">training 
  materials</a>--within this the "<a href="http://projects.edtech.sandi.net/staffdev/buildingblocks/p-index.htm">building 
  blocks</a>" link is essential, but look also at the more sophisticated information..

<p>Remember, the technology is a means to an end, not the end in itself; think 
  carefully about what you want students to learn. A webquest doesn't have to 
  rely solely on the web, use libraries and other resources. Learning how to research 
  is one of the most important educational skills.</p>
