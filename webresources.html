          Resources Assignment</b></font></font>
        <p align="left">For this assignment you will closely examine two web resources, 
          one for English teachers and one for English students. I have identified 
          some excellent <a href="http://www.wmich.edu/teachenglish/subpages/technology/teaching_resources.htm">content 
          focused web resources</a> as well as <a href="professionalorganizations.html">professional 
          organization sites</a> for teachers. You should look at as many of these 
          as you can and then choose one of each type to focus on. 
        <p align="left">(I also welcome you heading out on your own--help me expand 
          my list! Can you find good sites on English content, literature, culture, 
          writing, etc.?) 
        <p align="left">Write the equivalent of one page on each resource and 
          post this page on the appropriate item on the class <a href="http://vms.cc.wmich.edu/www/confer/">confer</a>. 
          Please include a hyperlink to the sites you are analyzing (on the confer, 
          type &quot;http://&quot; before the web address and a hyperlink will 
          be automatically created.
        <p align="left">How would this site serve as a useful resources for teachers 
          (or students)? What are the strengths and weaknesses of this site for 
          teaching and learning secondary English? Are they pedagogically sound? 
        <p align="left">Prepare to present your selected websites to the class. 
          Some of these sites are huge--what pages will be most important for 
          us to see? What do you want to say about these pages? Help us think 
          critically and carefully about content and delivery. 
        <p align="left">From your own research and that of your classmates, collect 
          the best resources and include links and brief annotations to these 
          sites on your website on both your student and teacher pages.
