      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Every English teacher should have a list, or even several lists, of recommended reading -- books that the teacher enjoys and thinks students might like too! Put your list on your website, and also have on paper to hand out.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Make your classroom a place that supports reading by talking about the books you like, having lots of book share /  talk opportunities, library visits, silent reading times, read alouds, literature circles, etc. Require outside reading, use outside reading as extra credit, and recognize in special ways students who read books from your list. Get them reading! </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Suggestions for your list:</font></p>
      <ul><li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Include books from a range of difficulty levels and help connect students to books appropriate to them. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Let students make suggestions to you, and, if you like the book too, include it on your list. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Choose books that will appeal to girls as well as boys, and include young adult and multicultural works.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Indicate titles with mature themes that may need parental approval. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Only list books you have read and you think will authentically interest students. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Share your book list with students, teachers, parents, and administrators &shy;- urge them all to make their own lists.</font></li>
        <li><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Point students to many wonderful reading lists out there, such as <a href="http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/yalsa/teenreading/recreading/recommendedreading.cfm" target="_blank">American Library Association's Good Reads for Teens</a>, <a href="http://www.teenreads.com/" target="_blank">TeenReads.com</a>, Gwen Tarbox's blog <a href="http://bookcandy.typepad.com/book_candy/" target="_blank">BookCandy</a>, <a href="http://comminfo.rutgers.edu/professional-development/childlit/YoungAdult/100list.html" target="_blank">Vandergrifts' 100</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_books" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://www.kpl.gov/teens/books.aspx" target="_blank">Kalamazoo Public Library</a>, and so many more!</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Write lively, engaging book descriptions on your list! Below are samples of approaches teachers have tried. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">For each annotated title, put an image of the cover -- and link that image, and the book title to the book page at Amazon. (See sample.) Covers will interest students and links to Amazon can help them  learn more about the book, read and enter into the on-line discussion about the book, and, of course, buy the book.  (You can even make money as an <a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Associate</a>!)</font></p>
