  Reading List</font> </div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every English teacher needs to have a list of recommended reading, books that 
  the teacher enjoys and thinks students might like too! Choose books that will 
  appeal to girls as well as boys, and include young adult and multicultural works. 
  Include books from a range of difficulty levels and help connect students to 
  books appropriate to them. Indicate titles with mature themes that may need 
  parental approval. Only list books <i>you</i> have read and you think will authentically 
  interest students. Share your book list with students, teachers, parents, and 
  administrators­urge them all to make their own lists. Let students make suggestions 
  to you, and, if you like the book too, include it on your list. </p>
<p>Make your classroom a place that supports reading by talking about the books 
  you like, having lots of book share opportunities, library visits, silent reading 
  times, read alouds, literature circles, etc. Require outside reading or use 
  outside reading as extra credit or recognize in special ways students who read 
  books from your list­get them all reading! </p>
<p>Write book descriptions that come alive.</p>
<p>Here are samples of suggested reading list webpages. Notice how images of the 
  book are used and serve as links to places where students can find books. See 
  the reading lists of: <a href="http://homepages.wmich.edu/%7Em8johnso/reading.html">Matt

<p> Here are samples of approaches former students have tried to writing book 
  descriptions: </p>
<p align="center"><b>Connect to Their Age Group </b></p>
<p><i>Taking Sides</i>, by Gary Soto Ever move to a new neighborhood? An Hispanic 
  American teenage basketball player has to leave the inner-city and try to fit 
  in in the suburbs. What will it be like? </p>
<p><i>We Hate Everything But Boys</i>, Linda Lewis A humorous coming of age story 
  about three girls who endure a variety of problems from parents, to friends, 
  to boys. </p>
<p><i>The Outsiders</i>, S.E. Hinton Ponyboy is 14 tough and confused, yet sensitive 
  beyond his bold front. Since his parent's death his loyalties have teen to his 
  brothers and his gang, the rough, swinging, longhaired boys from the wrong side 
  of the tracks. When his best friend Jonny kills a member of a rival gang, a 
  nightmare of violence begins and swiftly envelopes Ponyboy in a turbulent chain 
  of events. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Connect to Their Interests </b></p>
<p><i>As I Lay Dying</i>, William Faulkner This classic is about a family that 
  has to bury their mother. For those who like Quentin Tarintino, this is a must 
  because of all the disconnected view of the characters. </p>
<p><i>The Hundred Yard Lie</i>, Rick Telander Outlines the corruption which is 
  promoting decay in the world of college football. But Telander doesn¹t just 
  rip college football, he presents an alternative design to the current format 
  which is very thought-provoking. If you like ESPN's &quot;Sportcenter,&quot; 
  you will love this book! </p>
<p align="center"><b>Appeal to Their Curiosity</b> </p>
<p><i>Fahrenheit 451</i>, Ray Bradbury This is an intense science fiction book 
  written in the '50s. If nothing else, read this book to see if Mr. Bradbury' 
  predictions have come true. It's a great novel to get you thinking about the 
  future and all the books you read and television you watch. </p>
<p><i>Anthem</i>, Ayn Rand What if we did not have any choice? What would happen 
  if everything from out jobs to our hobbies were regulated by the government: 
  What would happen if we forgot the word &quot;I&quot;? </p>
<p align="center"><b>Create a Sense of Mystery </b></p>
<p><i>Frankenstein</i>, Mary Shelly Frankenstein is a horror novel set in Switzerland 
  in the late 1700's. Robert Walton, an explorer attempting to sail to the North 
  Pole, finds Victor Frankenstein, half-frozen on an ice flow. Walton¹s crew rescues 
  Frankenstein who then proceeds to unravel the events that let him to his fate. 
</p>
<p align="center"><b>Engage Their Sense of Justice</b> </p>
<p><i>Night </i>, Elie Wiesel Elie Wiesel, a survivor of the Nazi death camps 
  of W.W.II recalls the horror of one of humanities darkest episodes. Well-written 
  and, at times, shocking, the book will take you on an historical journey and, 
  in the process, will create within you an awareness of injustices which exist 
  yet today.</p>
<p><i>Warriors Don't Cry</i>, Melba Beals Is it hard to find friends and fit in? 
  The true story of sixteen-year-old Melba Beals, one of the first Black students 
  who had to try to fit in to an all white school in Little Rock, Arkansas, will 
  make the Civil Rights movement come alive for you. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Connect to Something Popular </b></p>
<p>&quot;Raisin in the Sun,&quot; Lorraine Hansberry Broke all records for the 
  longest running play on Broadway, a notable accomplishment for an African American 
  woman­Hansberry was the first from either category to write a Broadway hit. 
  The play is an enchanting and eye-opening drama with a focus on a determined 
  African American family searching for their dreams. </p>
<p><i>Tonto and the Lone Ranger Fist Fight in Heaven</i>, Sherman Alexi By America's 
  hottest Native American author telling the real story of contemporary life on 
  his reservation. Portions of the book were made into the hit film &quot;Smoke 
  Signals.&quot; </p>
<p align="center"><b>Sex, Taboo Appeal</b> </p>
<p><i>Forever</i>, Judy Blume. Many people have tried to ban this book because 
  it tells a story about what it is like for a high school girl to have sex for 
  the first time. Parental guidance recommended. </p>
<p><i>Am I Blue?</i>, Marian Dane Bauer Another book people want to ban, short 
  stories by top young adult authors with teenage main characters addressing in 
  many different ways homosexual family members, feelings, and friendships. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Appeal to a Sense of Humor </b></p>
<p><i>Don Quixote</i>, Miguel de Cervantes. This is 17th Century humor at its 
  finest! Cervantes tells of a hero/madman named Don Quixote who truly believes 
  he is a knight in shinning armor sallying forth for the common good. </p>
<p><i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, by William Shakespeare Think of the most 
  mixed up love story in your mom's soap operas; this one is worse. Not only do 
  four mixed up loves find themselves lost in the woods, the king and queen of 
  the fairies (along with their minions) confuse the whole situation even more! 
</p>
<p align="center"><b>Pass on Your Enthusiasm </b></p>
<p><i>Catch-22</i>, Joseph Heller A satirical look at the nature of war, and its 
  effect on those who fought in it. This is one of the funniest books I've ever 
  read. The basis of this story was used as a model for the movie and television 
  series, &quot;M*A*S*H.&quot; The books contains some questionable language and 
  situations, parental guidance. </p>
<p><i>Boss</i>, Mike Royko The story of the political machine of Chicago under 
  the control of Richard Daly, Boss takes a very interesting look at city politics 
  and government corruption. This book changed how I viewed the American government.</p>
